    "`SubscriptionTopic` resources contain information that is difficult to model without an appropriate resource to start from. There was an attempt to profile the `Basic` resource with extensions, but the complexity resulted in very low usability. Combined with use-case evaluation indicated that the most urgent and likely support of topic-based subscriptions would be relying on pre-defined topics with fixed canonical URLs (e.g., topics defined by an Implementation Guide), it was decided to leave topic definitions out-of-scope in R4.\n",

    "In order to allow for discovery of supported subscription topics, this guide defines the [CapabilityStatement SubscriptionTopic Canonical](StructureDefinition-capabilitystatement-subscriptiontopic-canonical.html) extension. The extension allows server implementers to advertise the canonical URLs of topics available to clients and allows clients to see the list of supported topics on a server. The extension is expected to appear, if supported, on the `Subscription` resource entry. Note that servers are NOT required to advertise supported topics via this extension. Supported topics can also be advertised, for example, by the `CapabilityStatement.instantiates` or `CapabilityStatement.implementationGuide` elements of a CapabilityStatement, as defined by another Implementation Guide. Finally, FHIR R4 servers MAY choose to leave topic discovery completely out-of-band and part of other steps, such as registration or integration.\n",
