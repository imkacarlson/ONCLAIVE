      ## Background

      The REQ-01 requirement states: **Health Plan API SHALL NOT require authentication for Plan-Net service access**.

      This test group verifies that the Health Plan API endpoints for Plan-Net resources
      (Organization, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, HealthcareService, Location, Network)
      can be accessed without requiring authentication credentials (e.g., an OAuth 2.0 bearer token).

      ## Test Methodology

      This test group performs HTTP GET requests to the specified Plan-Net resource type endpoints:
      - `GET {Base URL}/[Resource Type]`

      These requests are intentionally sent *without* an `Authorization` header or any other
      authentication mechanism.

      ## Validation Criteria

      The tests PASS if the server responds without indicating an authentication requirement:
      - The HTTP status code **is NOT** 401 (Unauthorized).
      - The HTTP status code **is NOT** 403 (Forbidden).
      - The response headers **do NOT** include a `WWW-Authenticate` header.

      Receiving a 200 (OK) or 404 (Not Found) is considered successful access without authentication.
      Other error codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) are not considered
      failures *for this specific authentication requirement*, although they may indicate other issues.

      **Note:** These tests focus solely on the *absence* of authentication requirements. They do not
      validate the content of the response body or full FHIR conformance of the endpoints beyond
      the access control aspect.
