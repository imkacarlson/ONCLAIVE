    title 'REQ-03: No Consumer Information in Queries'
    description %(
      **Requirement:** Application Actor SHALL NOT send consumer identifiable information when querying a Plan-Net service.

      **Description:** This test checks that the Application Actor (the system under test) does not include
      consumer identifiable information (such as patient names, identifiers, addresses, etc., unless
      explicitly permitted by the specific query context and privacy policies) in the parameters
      or headers of its queries to the Plan-Net FHIR server.

      **Note:** This test requires manual attestation. Inferno, when testing a server, cannot automatically
      verify the outgoing requests made by a separate client system (Application Actor). Testers must
      ensure their client application adheres to this requirement. This test serves as a reminder and
      point of attestation for this client-side requirement.

        Verify that the Application Actor (client system) does not send consumer identifiable information
        (e.g., patient names, specific identifiers not essential for the query) when querying the Plan-Net service.

        **Instructions:** Manually review the queries your application sends to the Plan-Net
        service during typical operation or testing scenarios. Confirm that no prohibited consumer
        identifiable information is included in query parameters, headers, or body content.

        This test will be marked as 'skipped' to indicate that automated validation is not performed
        by Inferno for this client-side requirement. Manual confirmation of compliance is necessary.

        # If, in a specific testing scenario (e.g., client testing where Inferno acts as the server),
        # request inspection were possible, the logic would go here. For standard server testing,
        # skipping with instructions is the appropriate approach for client-side requirements.
        # Example (Conceptual - Requires Request Logging/Inspection):
        # request_logs = get_incoming_requests_somehow()
        # request_logs.each do |request|
        #   assert !request.url.include?('patient_name='), "Request URL contains potentially identifiable info: patient_name"
        #   assert !request.headers['X-Patient-ID'], "Request header contains potentially identifiable info: X-Patient-ID"
        #   # Add more checks for specific fields based on Plan-Net IG constraints
        # end
        # pass "Verified that received requests did not contain prohibited consumer identifiable information."
