    title 'Missing Must Support data elements are interpreted as data not present'
    description %(
      Verify that the application correctly interprets missing Must Support data elements as data not present in the Health Plan API system.

      This test is intended to be implemented as a placeholder for a manual review process. 
      Due to the nature of this requirement, automated testing is not feasible. 

      **Manual Review Steps:**

      1. **Identify Resources with Must Support Elements:** Review the implementation guide for the specific API being tested and identify resources that contain Must Support data elements.
      2. **Simulate Missing Data:** Construct requests to the system under test that omit these Must Support elements.
      3. **Observe Application Behavior:** Carefully examine how the application handles the responses containing missing Must Support data.
      4. **Verify Interpretation:** Confirm that the application does not treat the absence of these elements as an error. Instead, it should interpret the missing data as not being present in the Health Plan API system.

      **Example:**

      If a `Patient` resource defines the `birthDate` element as "Must Support", the application should not issue an error if it receives a `Patient` resource without a `birthDate`.

      **Pass Criteria:**

      This test is considered to have passed if the manual review confirms that the application correctly interprets missing Must Support data elements as data not present, as described above.
