      Verify that the application actor can display Must Support data elements for human use.

      This test verifies the SHOULD requirement: "Application Actor SHOULD display Must Support data elements for human use or store for other purposes."

      This test is marked as skipped because Inferno cannot directly validate the display of data elements in the application. It is the responsibility of the tester to manually verify that Must Support elements are appropriately displayed within the application.
