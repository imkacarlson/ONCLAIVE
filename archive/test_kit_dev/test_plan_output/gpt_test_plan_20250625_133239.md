### REQ-02: No PII sending by clients

**Description**: "A directory mobile application SHALL NOT send consumer identifiable information when querying a Plan-Net service."

**Actor**: Application Actor

**Conformance**: SHALL NOT

# Test Specification for REQ-02

## 1. Requirement ID
REQ-02

## 2. Requirement Analysis

### Testability Assessment
- **Classification**: Attestation
  - This requirement is best verified through inspection and attestation, as it involves ensuring that no personally identifiable information (PII) is sent by the client application. Automated testing can be challenging due to the need for context-specific knowledge about what constitutes PII.

### Complexity
- **Complexity**: Moderate
  - While the requirement itself is straightforward, verifying that no PII is sent requires a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes PII in the context of the application and the data it handles.

### Prerequisites
- **System Configurations**: 
  - The directory mobile application must be configured to interact with the Plan-Net service.
  - Ensure that the application has access to a network environment where it can query the Plan-Net service.

- **Data Setup**: 
  - Use test data that simulates consumer interactions without including any PII.
  - Ensure that the test environment does not inadvertently include PII in any test data or configurations.

## 3. Test Implementation Strategy

### Required Inputs
- **FHIR Resources**: 
  - The test does not require specific FHIR resources but should ensure that any queries made to the Plan-Net service do not include PII.
  
- **Expected Outputs**:
  - Confirmation that no PII is included in any requests sent to the Plan-Net service.

### Required FHIR Operations
- **API Calls/Operations**:
  - `GET` requests to the Plan-Net service endpoints as specified in the Capability Statement.
  - Ensure that these operations are supported by the Plan-Net service and are part of the general capabilities.

### Validation Criteria
- **Specific Checks**:
  - Inspect the payload of each request sent by the application to ensure no fields contain PII.
  - Validate that the application adheres to the requirement by reviewing logs or network traces for any instances of PII.
  - Assertions should include:
    - No presence of identifiable fields such as names, social security numbers, personal addresses, or any other data classified as PII.
    - Logs or network traces should be reviewed to ensure compliance with the requirement.
  
- **Inspection**:
  - Conduct a manual review of the applicationâ€™s codebase or configuration to ensure that it does not include logic that would inadvertently send PII.
  - Obtain attestation from the application developers or maintainers confirming that no PII is sent in any requests.

This test specification ensures that the directory mobile application complies with the requirement of not sending PII when querying the Plan-Net service, focusing on interoperability conformance and leveraging a bring-your-own-data approach.

  - Any relevant FHIR resources that are part of Plan-Net interactions, such as `Practitioner`, `Organization`, `Location`, etc.
- **Expected Outputs**: 
  - The response from the Health Plan API should be in JSON format and should adhere to the structure defined by the FHIR standard.

### Required FHIR Operations
- **API Calls/Operations**:
  - `GET [base]/Practitioner`
  - `GET [base]/Organization`
  - `GET [base]/Location`
  - Any other Plan-Net specific interactions as defined in the Capability Statement.

### Validation Criteria
- **Format Verification**:
  - Ensure that the `Content-Type` header in the HTTP response is `application/fhir+json`.
  - Validate that the response body is a well-formed JSON object.
- **FHIR Conformance**:
  - Verify that the JSON response conforms to the FHIR resource structure as defined in the FHIR specification.
  - Use a FHIR validator tool to check the JSON response against the FHIR profiles applicable to the Plan-Net interactions.
- **Interoperability Check**:
  - Ensure that the JSON responses can be parsed and understood by a FHIR-compliant client application.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Test that the API gracefully handles requests for unsupported formats (e.g., XML) by returning an appropriate error message, indicating that only JSON is supported.

By following this test specification, testers can ensure that the Health Plan API conforms to the requirement of supporting JSON format for all Plan-Net interactions, thereby achieving interoperability conformance as specified in the FHIR Implementation Guide.

### Required Inputs
- **FHIR Resources**: 
  - Identify all relevant FHIR resources that include Must Support elements (e.g., `Coverage`, `Patient`, `Claim`, etc.).
- **Expected Outputs**: 
  - Each queried FHIR resource should include all Must Support elements populated as part of the response.

### Required FHIR Operations
- **API Calls/Operations**:
  - `GET [base]/[resource]?[parameters]`: Retrieve instances of each relevant FHIR resource.
  - Ensure these operations are supported as per the Capability Statement.

### Validation Criteria
- **Specific Checks**:
  - For each FHIR resource type, identify Must Support elements based on the Implementation Guide.
  - Query the Health Plan API for each resource type.
  - Validate that the response includes all Must Support elements:
    - **Presence Check**: Verify that each Must Support element is present in the response.
    - **Non-Null Check**: Ensure that Must Support elements are not null or empty unless explicitly allowed by the specification.
- **Assertions**:
  - The test passes if all Must Support elements are present and populated in the response for each queried resource.
  - The test fails if any Must Support element is missing or not populated as required.

This test specification provides a structured approach to verify the conformance of Health Plan API actors in populating Must Support data elements, ensuring interoperability and compliance with the FHIR Implementation Guide requirements.
