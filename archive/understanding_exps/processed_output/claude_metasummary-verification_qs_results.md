Yes, there are several workflows defined in the FHIR DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide, although they are not explicitly labeled as "workflows." Instead, the IG describes various use cases and scenarios that imply specific workflows. Here are some key workflows that can be identified:

1. Provider Directory Search and Discovery:
   - This is a core workflow where users (patients, care coordinators, or other providers) search for healthcare providers, services, or locations based on various criteria like specialty, location, network status, etc.

2. Network Adequacy Assessment:
   - This workflow involves analyzing the provider network to ensure it meets regulatory requirements for coverage and accessibility.

3. Provider Roster Management:
   - This workflow covers the process of adding, updating, or removing providers from a network or organization's directory.

4. Insurance Plan and Network Association:
   - This workflow involves associating providers and organizations with specific insurance plans and networks.

5. Virtual Care Service Discovery:
   - A workflow for identifying providers or services that offer virtual care options, including relevant endpoints for telehealth services.

6. New Patient Acceptance Verification:
   - A workflow to determine if a provider is accepting new patients, which may involve checking multiple factors like specialties, locations, and insurance plans.

7. Provider Credentialing and Validation:
   - While not a primary focus of PlanNet, there are elements that support workflows related to provider credentialing and ongoing validation of qualifications.

8. Service Location Determination:
   - A workflow for identifying where specific healthcare services are provided, which may span multiple physical or virtual locations.

9. Referral Management:

## Question
What actions (REST/CRUD) or operations can be used in the FHIR DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide?

## Test Engineering Analysis
The FHIR DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide primarily uses standard FHIR RESTful CRUD operations and search capabilities. The key actions and operations include:

1. Create (POST): Used to add new resources to the server.
   Example: POST /Practitioner

2. Read (GET): Retrieves a specific resource by its ID.
   Example: GET /Practitioner/{id}

3. Update (PUT): Updates an existing resource.
   Example: PUT /Practitioner/{id}

4. Delete (DELETE): Removes a resource from the server.
   Example: DELETE /Practitioner/{id}

5. Search (GET with parameters): Allows querying for resources based on specific criteria.
   Example: GET /Practitioner?name=Smith

6. _include and _revinclude: These are search result parameters that allow including related resources in a single query.
   Example: GET /Organization?_include=OrganizationAffiliation:participating-organization

7. Chaining: Allows searching based on attributes of associated resources.
   Example: GET /PractitionerRole?practitioner.name=Smith

8. _history: Retrieves the version history of a resource.
   Example: GET /Practitioner/{id}/_history

9. Conditional Create/Update: Allows creating or updating resources based on specific criteria.
   Example: PUT /Practitioner?identifier=http://example.org/fhir/identifier/mrn|12345

While not explicitly defined as custom operations, the IG relies heavily on these standard FHIR capabilities to support the complex relationships and queries needed for provider directory management.

Key testing implications:
1. Verify correct implementation of all CRUD operations for each resource type.
2. Test complex search scenarios, especially those involving multiple parameters and chaining.
3. Validate _include and _revinclude functionality for related resources.
4. Ensure proper handling of conditional create/update operations.
5. Test version history retrieval and management.
6. Verify that all required search parameters are supported and function correctly.

This analysis suggests a comprehensive testing approach covering basic CRUD operations, advanced search capabilities, and the relationships between different resource types in the provider directory context.

## Question
What are all the mandatory requirements and rules from the DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide for compliant implementations? Which ones are fulfilled from the code you wrote to test those items from the last question?

## Test Engineering Analysis
The FHIR DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide specifies several mandatory requirements and rules for compliant implementations. Here are the key mandatory requirements:

1. FHIR Compliance:
   - Must support FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)
   - Must support JSON format (XML is recommended but not mandatory)
   - Must implement RESTful API as per FHIR specification

2. US Core Compatibility:
   - Must be compatible with US Core IG v3.1.1

3. Profile Support:
   - Must support all defined Plan-Net profiles (Endpoint, HealthcareService, InsurancePlan, Location, Network, Organization, OrganizationAffiliation, Practitioner, PractitionerRole)
   - Must use meta.profile to identify supported profiles

4. Search Parameters:
   - Must support all specified search parameters for each resource type
   - Must implement _include and _revinclude capabilities

5. Must Support Elements:
   - Must support all elements marked as "Must Support" in the profiles

6. Required Extensions:
   - Must implement all required extensions (e.g., endpoint-usecase, network-reference)

7. Slice Definitions:
   - Must adhere to all slice definitions in the profiles

8. Terminology Bindings:
   - Must respect all required terminology bindings

9. Referential Integrity:
   - Must maintain referential integrity between related resources

10. HTTP Response Codes:
    - Must correctly handle HTTP response codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 410)

11. US Address Format:
    - Must adhere to US address format requirements

12. CapabilityStatement:
    - Must provide a CapabilityStatement that accurately reflects the server's capabilities

Regarding the code skeleton provided in the previous answer, it addresses some of these requirements, but not all. Here's what it covers:

- Basic CRUD operations for resources (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Some basic search parameter testing
- HTTP response code checking (implicitly through assertions)

However, the skeleton doesn't explicitly cover:

- Profile validation
- Must Support element verification
- Extension implementation
- Slice definition adherence
- Terminology binding validation
- Referential integrity checks
- _include and _revinclude testing
- US address format validation
- CapabilityStatement validation

To fully test compliance with the IG, you would need to expand the code to include these aspects. This would involve:

1. Implementing profile validation against published StructureDefinitions
2. Checking for the presence and correct usage of all Must Support elements
3. Validating the implementation of required extensions
4. Verifying adherence to slice definitions
5. Implementing terminology validation against required value sets
6. Checking referential integrity across related resources
7. Testing _include and _revinclude scenarios
8. Validating US address format in relevant fields
9. Retrieving and validating the server's CapabilityStatement

These additional tests would significantly enhance the coverage and ensure a more comprehensive validation of compliance with the PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide.

## Question
What are all the optional requirements and rules from the DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide for compliant implementations?

## Test Engineering Analysis
The DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide specifies several optional requirements and rules for compliant implementations. Based on my review, the key optional elements include:

1. XML Support:
   - Support for XML format is recommended but not mandatory. JSON support is required, but XML is optional.

2. Additional Search Parameters:  
   - Servers may implement additional search parameters beyond the mandatory ones specified for each resource type.

3. Custom Operations:
   - Implementers may define custom operations beyond the standard FHIR operations, though none are explicitly defined in the IG.

4. Extended Profiles:
   - Systems may extend the defined profiles with additional elements or constraints, as long as they don't break conformance to the base profiles.

5. Additional Slices:
   - Implementers may add additional slices to sliced elements, beyond those defined in the profiles.

6. Non-US Deployments:
   - While the IG is US-focused, it can be adapted for non-US deployments. In such cases, US-specific requirements (like address formats) become optional.

7. Additional Extensions:
   - Systems may implement additional extensions beyond those required by the IG.

8. Enhanced Versioning:
   - While basic versioning is required, enhanced versioning capabilities (like version-specific retrieval) are optional.

9. Bulk Data:
   - Support for FHIR Bulk Data Access IG is optional but recommended for large datasets.

10. Advanced Search Capabilities:
    - While basic search is required, advanced features like :contains or :exact modifiers are optional.

11. Resource History:
    - Maintaining and providing access to resource history beyond current versions is optional.

12. Conditional References:
    - Support for conditional references in resource creation/updating is optional.

13. _summary Parameter:
    - Support for the _summary parameter in search operations is optional.

14. Additional Response Formats:
    - Servers may optionally support additional response formats beyond JSON (and optionally XML).

When developing a test suite, it's important to clearly distinguish between mandatory and optional requirements. Tests for optional features should be clearly marked and should not cause a failure if the feature is not implemented. Instead, they should be reported as "not supported" or skipped if the feature is absent.
