I can help you analyze FHIR Implementation Guide requirements and outline automated test scripts. 

Please provide the specific details (Summary, Description, Verification, etc.) for each requirement (R1, R2, etc.) you want to assess. I'll then provide a breakdown for each, addressing:

1. **Algorithmic Verifiability:**  Whether the requirement can be objectively tested with code.
2. **FHIR API Interactions:**  The necessary FHIR API calls (read, search, create, etc.) to interact with the system under test.
3. **Assertions/Validations:**  The specific checks to confirm the system's response aligns with the requirement.
4. **Test Data Prerequisites:**  Any data that needs to be pre-loaded or available for the test to execute.
5. **Pseudocode Outline:**  A high-level code structure demonstrating the test logic.

**Example (Provide your requirements in a similar format):**

**R1**
* **Summary:** Patient resources SHALL contain a valid identifier.
* **Description:** All Patient resources must have at least one identifier element populated with a system and value.
* **Verification:** Automated
* **Actor:** Server
* **Conformance:** SHALL
* **Conditional:** N/A
* **Source:**  FHIR Core Specification

**Analysis of R1:**

1. **Algorithmic Verifiability:** Yes
2. **FHIR API Interactions:** 
    * `GET /Patient/{id}` (Retrieve a Patient resource)
3. **Assertions/Validations:**
    * Assert that the response status code is 200 (OK).
    * Assert that the `identifier` element in the response is present and not empty.
    * Assert that each identifier within the `identifier` element has a `system` and `value` property.
4. **Test Data Prerequisites:**
    * A Patient resource must exist in the system.
5. **Pseudocode Outline:**

```python
def test_patient_has_valid_identifier(client, patient_id):
  """Tests that a Patient resource has a valid identifier.

  Args:
    client: A FHIR client for interacting with the server.
    patient_id: The ID of the Patient resource to test.
  """

  response = client.read('Patient', patient_id) 
  assert response.status_code == 200

  patient = response.json()
  assert 'identifier' in patient 
  assert len(patient['identifier']) > 0

  for identifier in patient['identifier']:
    assert 'system' in identifier and identifier['system']
    assert 'value' in identifier and identifier['value'] 
``` 

**Remember:**  For more complex requirements, especially those involving workflows or clinical reasoning, full automation might not be feasible. In such cases, I'll explain the limitations and suggest a hybrid approach combining automated checks with manual review or specialized testing tools.
