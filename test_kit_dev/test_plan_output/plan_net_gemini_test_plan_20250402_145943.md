### REQ-04: Prohibit sending consumer identifiable information when querying Plan-Net.

**Description**: "A directory mobile application **SHALL NOT** send consumer identifiable information when querying a Plan-Net service."

**Actor**: Client

**Conformance**: SHALL NOT

## Test Specification for REQ-04: Prohibit Sending Consumer Identifiable Information

### 1. Requirement Analysis

* **Testability Assessment:** Hybrid (Combination of automated API calls and manual data inspection)
* **Complexity:** Moderate
* **Prerequisites:**
    * A running instance of the directory mobile application (Client).
    * Access to the Plan-Net service endpoint.
    * Test user accounts for the mobile application.
    * A list of defined "consumer identifiable information" fields according to the FHIR Implementation Guide. This list should include direct identifiers like name, address, and date of birth, as well as indirect identifiers like medical record numbers and device identifiers.

### 2. Test Implementation Strategy

* **Required FHIR Operations:**
    * **Search:** Execute various search queries against the Plan-Net service.
* **Test Data Requirements:**
    * **Valid Search Parameters:** Prepare a set of valid search parameters that do not contain consumer identifiable information (e.g., plan type, location).
    * **Invalid Search Parameters:** Prepare a set of search parameters that include consumer identifiable information (e.g., patient name, patient identifier).
* **Validation Criteria:**
    * **Positive Test Cases:** Verify that the mobile application successfully sends requests and receives responses from the Plan-Net service when using valid search parameters.
    * **Negative Test Cases:** Verify that the mobile application does not include any consumer identifiable information in the request payload when using invalid search parameters. This can be achieved by:
        * Inspecting the outgoing HTTP request payload manually or using a proxy tool.
        * Verifying the application logs for any error messages or warnings related to sending prohibited information.

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Define FHIR client for Plan-Net service
client = FHIR::Client.new('https://plan-net.example.com/fhir')

# Define test data
valid_search_params = { plan_type: 'dental' }
invalid_search_params = { patient_name: 'John Doe' }

# Positive Test Case
def test_valid_search(client, search_params)
  begin
    response = client.search('Plan', search: { parameters: search_params })
    # Assert response status code is 200 (OK)
    if response.code == 200
      puts "Positive Test Case: Valid search successful."
      return true
    else
      puts "Positive Test Case: Unexpected response code: #{response.code}"
      return false
    end
  rescue => e
    puts "Positive Test Case: Error during search: #{e.message}"
    return false
  end
end

# Negative Test Case
def test_invalid_search(client, search_params)
  begin
    # Attempt the search (expecting an error or request modification)
    client.search('Plan', search: { parameters: search_params })
    puts "Negative Test Case: FAILED - Request sent with identifiable information."
    return false
  rescue => e
    # Assert the error message indicates prohibited information
    if e.message.include?("Consumer identifiable information is prohibited")
      puts "Negative Test Case: PASSED - Identifiable information blocked."
      return true
    else
      puts "Negative Test Case: FAILED - Unexpected error: #{e.message}"
      return false
    end
  end
end

# Run the tests
test_valid_search(client, valid_search_params)
test_invalid_search(client, invalid_search_params)
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Incomplete List of Identifiable Information:** The test cases rely on a comprehensive list of consumer identifiable information. If the list is incomplete, the application might leak sensitive data without triggering the negative test case.
* **Data Encoding:** The application might try to obfuscate identifiable information using encoding techniques. The test cases should consider and handle various encoding mechanisms.
* **Performance Impact:** Repeatedly inspecting outgoing requests for large datasets might impact performance. Consider implementing targeted checks or sampling strategies.
* **Security:** Ensure that the testing process itself does not compromise the security of the application or expose sensitive information. Use test environments and anonymized data whenever possible.

### REQ-08: Process resource instances containing Must Support data elements without errors.

**Description**: "Application actors **SHALL** be capable of processing resource instances containing the Must Support data elements without generating an error or causing the application to fail."

**Actor**: Client

**Conformance**: SHALL

## Test Specification for REQ-08: Process Must Support Data Elements

### 1. Requirement Analysis

* **Testability Assessment**: **Automatic** (can be automated with FHIR client libraries)
* **Complexity**: **Moderate** (requires understanding of Must Support elements and resource structure)
* **Prerequisites**:
    * A running FHIR server under test.
    * A list of resources and their corresponding Must Support data elements as defined in the FHIR Implementation Guide.
    * A FHIR client library (e.g., fhir-client gem for Ruby).
    * Test data for each resource type containing Must Support elements.

---

### 2. Test Implementation Strategy

* **Required FHIR Operations**: 
    * **CREATE**: To submit resources containing Must Support data elements.
    * **READ**: To retrieve the created resources and verify data persistence.

* **Test Data Requirements**:
    * For each resource type with Must Support elements:
        * Create valid FHIR resources containing all Must Support elements populated with valid data.
        * Consider different data types and value ranges for each element (e.g., string lengths, code systems).

* **Validation Criteria**:
    * **HTTP Status Code**: Verify the server returns a successful response code (e.g., 201 Created for CREATE).
    * **Resource Validation**: Optionally validate the returned resource against the FHIR profile to ensure data integrity.
    * **Error Handling**:  Confirm the server does not return errors related to the presence of Must Support elements.

---

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Configure FHIR client
client = FHIR::Client.new('https://your-fhir-server-url')

# Define test cases for each resource type
test_cases = [
  {
    resource_type: 'Patient',
    must_support_elements: ['name', 'birthDate'],
    test_data: {
      name: [{ family: 'Doe', given: ['John'] }],
      birthDate: '1980-01-01'
    }
  },
  # ... Add more test cases for other resource types
]

# Iterate through test cases
test_cases.each do |test_case|
  begin
    # Construct resource instance with Must Support data
    resource = FHIR.const_get(test_case[:resource_type]).new(test_case[:test_data])

    # CREATE operation
    response = client.create(resource)

    # Validate HTTP status code
    if response.code != 201
      raise "Test Failed: Expected 201 Created, got #{response.code} for #{test_case[:resource_type]}"
    end

    # Optionally validate the returned resource against the profile

    # READ operation to verify data persistence
    retrieved_resource = client.read(test_case[:resource_type], response.resource.id).resource

    # Validate Must Support elements are present in the retrieved resource
    test_case[:must_support_elements].each do |element|
      if retrieved_resource.send(element).nil?
        raise "Test Failed: Must Support element '#{element}' missing in retrieved #{test_case[:resource_type]}"
      end
    end

    puts "Test Passed for #{test_case[:resource_type]}"

  rescue => e
    puts "Test Failed for #{test_case[:resource_type]}: #{e.message}"
  end
end
```

---

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Resource Cardinality**: Test with minimum and maximum cardinality for Must Support elements, including zero-to-many elements.
* **Data Types and Constraints**:  Use edge case values for data types (e.g., very long strings, date ranges) to test validation and error handling.
* **Code Systems**: Ensure the server correctly handles valid and invalid codes from required code systems.
* **Performance**:  Test with large datasets or complex resources to assess performance impact of processing Must Support elements.
* **Security**:  Verify that sensitive data within Must Support elements is handled securely (e.g., masked in responses if applicable).

<a id='req-09'></a>

### REQ-09: Display or store Must Support data elements.

**Description**: "Application actors **SHOULD** be capable of displaying the data elements for human use or storing the information for other purposes."

**Actor**: Client

**Conformance**: SHOULD

## Test Specification for REQ-09: Display or Store Must Support Data Elements

### 1. Requirement Analysis

* **Testability Assessment:** Hybrid (Manual inspection of display combined with automated API testing)
* **Complexity:** Moderate
* **Prerequisites:**
    * A running instance of the application under test.
    * A test FHIR server populated with resources containing "Must Support" data elements.
    * Access credentials for the test FHIR server.
    * Knowledge of the specific "Must Support" data elements defined in the FHIR Implementation Guide.

### 2. Test Implementation Strategy

* **Required FHIR Operations:**
    * **Read:** Retrieve resources containing "Must Support" data elements from the test FHIR server.
* **Test Data Requirements:**
    * At least one FHIR resource instance containing the "Must Support" data elements.
    * The resource type and specific "Must Support" elements should be defined by the FHIR Implementation Guide being tested.
* **Validation Criteria:**
    * **Positive Test Case:**
        * **Automated:** Verify that the application can successfully retrieve the resource containing "Must Support" data elements via the FHIR API.
        * **Manual:**  Visually inspect the application's user interface to confirm that the "Must Support" data elements are displayed in a human-readable format.
    * **Negative Test Case:**
        * Not applicable as the requirement uses "SHOULD," meaning it's a recommendation, not a strict requirement. The application is not required to fail if it doesn't display or store the data.

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# **Test Case: Verify Display/Storage of Must Support Data Elements**

# **Setup**
client = FHIR::Client.new('https://test-fhir-server.com/api')
client.use_r4
resource_type = 'Patient' # Replace with the actual resource type
resource_id = '12345' # Replace with the actual resource ID

# **Test Execution**
begin
  # 1. Retrieve the resource
  resource = client.read(resource_type, resource_id).resource

  # 2. Check if the resource was retrieved successfully
  if resource.nil?
    raise "Error: Failed to retrieve resource of type '#{resource_type}' with ID '#{resource_id}'"
  end

  # 3. (Automated) Verify the presence of "Must Support" data elements
  #    - This part depends on the specific "Must Support" elements defined in the FHIR IG.
  #    - Example: Check if 'Patient.name' element is present
  if resource.name.empty?
    raise "Error: 'Must Support' element 'Patient.name' is missing."
  end

  # 4. (Manual) Visually inspect the application to confirm the display of "Must Support" data elements.

  puts "Test Passed: Successfully retrieved and validated 'Must Support' data elements."

rescue => e
  puts "Test Failed: #{e.message}"
end
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Data Sensitivity:**  Ensure that displaying sensitive "Must Support" data elements adheres to privacy regulations and access control policies.
* **Performance:** Retrieving and displaying large amounts of data could impact performance. Consider pagination or lazy loading strategies.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API calls and data parsing. Display user-friendly error messages in the user interface.
* **Usability:** Ensure that the display of "Must Support" data elements is clear, concise, and easily understandable for human users. Consider using appropriate formatting, labels, and tooltips.

<a id='req-10'></a>

### REQ-10: Interpret missing Must Support data elements as not present in the Health Plan API system.

**Description**: "When querying Health Plan API actors, Application actors **SHALL** interpret missing Must Support data elements within resource instances as data not present in the Health Plan API actors system."

**Actor**: Client

**Conformance**: SHALL

## Test Specification for REQ-10: Interpret Missing Must Support Data Elements

### 1. Requirement Analysis

* **Testability Assessment:**  **Hybrid** (Combination of automated API calls and manual assertion of logic)
* **Complexity:** **Moderate** (Requires understanding of Must Support, data element presence, and client-side interpretation)
* **Prerequisites:**
    * A running FHIR server implementing the Health Plan API.
    * A client application capable of making FHIR API requests.
    * Test data loaded into the FHIR server, including resources with intentionally missing "Must Support" data elements.

### 2. Test Implementation Strategy

#### 2.1 Required FHIR Operations:

* **READ Operation:** Used to retrieve resources from the FHIR server.
* **Search Operation:** Used to query for resources based on specific criteria.

#### 2.2 Test Data Requirements:

* **Resource Type:** Choose a resource type relevant to the Health Plan API that contains "Must Support" data elements (e.g., `Coverage`, `Patient`, `Claim`).
* **Test Data Variations:**
    * **Resource with Missing Must Support Element:** Create a resource instance where a "Must Support" data element is entirely absent.
    * **Resource with Empty Must Support Element:** Create a resource instance where a "Must Support" data element is present but empty (e.g., an empty string or array).

#### 2.3 Validation Criteria:

* **Positive Test Case:** When the client application receives a resource with a missing "Must Support" data element, it should interpret this as the data element not being present in the Health Plan API system. The application should **NOT** throw an error or treat it as an invalid response.
* **Negative Test Case:**  (Not applicable for this requirement as it focuses on client-side behavior)

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Establish connection to the FHIR server
client = FHIR::Client.new('https://your-fhir-server-endpoint')

# Resource type to test
resource_type = 'Coverage' 

# Search for resources with potentially missing Must Support data elements
search_params = {
  # Add specific search parameters if needed
}

begin
  response = client.search(resource_type, search: search_params)

  # Iterate through each resource in the Bundle
  response.resource.entry.each do |entry|
    resource = entry.resource

    # Identify Must Support data elements for this resource type (refer to IG)
    must_support_elements = ['status', 'class'] # Example elements

    must_support_elements.each do |element|
      # Check if the element is present in the resource
      if !resource.send(element.to_sym)
        puts "Must Support element '#{element}' is missing. Interpreting as not present in the system."
        # Add logic here to handle the missing element as "not present"
      else
        puts "Must Support element '#{element}' is present."
      end
    end
  end

rescue => e
  puts "An error occurred: #{e.message}"
end
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Identifying "Must Support" Elements:** The pseudocode assumes you have a way to programmatically determine which elements are marked as "Must Support" for a given resource type. This might require parsing the Implementation Guide or using tooling that provides this information.
* **Data Type Handling:** The provided pseudocode uses a simple check for element presence. You might need to adjust the logic based on the data type of the "Must Support" element (e.g., checking for empty strings, empty arrays, or specific null values).
* **Client-Side Logic:** This test focuses on the client's interpretation. Ensure your client-side application logic aligns with the requirement and handles missing "Must Support" elements gracefully without causing errors or unexpected behavior.
* **Performance:**  Querying for resources and iterating through them can impact performance, especially with large datasets. Consider using appropriate pagination or filtering techniques.

<a id='req-11'></a>

### REQ-11: Process resource instances containing Must Support data elements asserting missing information.

**Description**: "Consumer App actors **SHALL** be able to process resource instances containing Must Support data elements asserting missing information."

**Actor**: Client

**Conformance**: SHALL

## Test Specification for REQ-11: Process Must Support Data Elements Asserting Missing Information

### 1. Requirement Analysis

* **Testability Assessment:**  Automatic
* **Complexity:** Moderate
* **Prerequisites:** 
    * A running FHIR server compliant with the relevant FHIR Implementation Guide.
    * Test Patient resources with "Must Support" data elements marked as missing using the `dataAbsentReason` extension as defined in the FHIR specification.
    * A client application (test harness) capable of making FHIR API calls and evaluating responses.

### 2. Test Implementation Strategy

* **Required FHIR Operations:** 
    * **POST** `/Patient` (Create a new Patient resource)
    * **GET** `/Patient/{id}` (Retrieve the created Patient resource)

* **Test Data Requirements:**
    * **Test Patient Resource 1 (Valid):** A Patient resource with a "Must Support" element (e.g., `birthDate`) marked as missing using a valid `dataAbsentReason` code (e.g., "unknown").
    * **Test Patient Resource 2 (Invalid):** A Patient resource with a "Must Support" element missing **without** a `dataAbsentReason` extension.

* **Validation Criteria:**
    * **Positive Test Case:** The client application should successfully create and retrieve the Patient resource with the "Must Support" element marked as missing using `dataAbsentReason`. The response should return HTTP status code `201 Created` for the POST request and `200 OK` for the GET request.
    * **Negative Test Case:** The client application should **not** be able to create the Patient resource without a valid `dataAbsentReason` for the missing "Must Support" element. The response should return an HTTP status code `4xx` (e.g., `400 Bad Request`) indicating an error.

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Configure FHIR client
client = FHIR::Client.new('https://your-fhir-server-url')

# Test Data
valid_patient = {
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "name": [
    {
      "family": "Doe",
      "given": ["John"]
    }
  ],
  "birthDate": {
    "extension": [
      {
        "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason",
        "valueCode": "unknown"
      }
    ]
  }
}

invalid_patient = {
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "name": [
    {
      "family": "Doe",
      "given": ["Jane"]
    }
  ]
}

# Positive Test Case
begin
  create_response = client.create(resource: valid_patient)
  if create_response.code == 201
    patient_id = create_response.resource.id
    get_response = client.read(resource: 'Patient', id: patient_id)
    if get_response.code == 200
      puts "Positive Test Case: PASSED"
    else
      puts "Positive Test Case: FAILED - Unable to retrieve Patient resource."
    end
  else
    puts "Positive Test Case: FAILED - Unable to create Patient resource."
  end
rescue => e
  puts "Positive Test Case: ERROR - #{e.message}"
end

# Negative Test Case
begin
  create_response = client.create(resource: invalid_patient)
  if create_response.code >= 400
    puts "Negative Test Case: PASSED"
  else
    puts "Negative Test Case: FAILED - Patient resource created without required dataAbsentReason."
  end
rescue => e
  puts "Negative Test Case: ERROR - #{e.message}"
end
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Different `dataAbsentReason` codes:** Test with various valid and invalid `dataAbsentReason` codes to ensure proper handling.
* **Multiple missing "Must Support" elements:** Test with resources containing multiple missing "Must Support" elements, both with and without `dataAbsentReason`.
* **Resource updates:** Test updating existing resources to introduce missing "Must Support" elements.
* **Performance:** Evaluate the performance impact of processing resources with missing data, especially with large datasets.
* **Security:** Ensure that sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed through missing data elements or error messages.

## InsurancePlan

<a id='req-13'></a>

### REQ-13: Payers shall offer one or more InsurancePlans.

**Description**: "Each payer will offer one or more products -- Insurance Plans"

**Actor**: Payer

**Conformance**: SHALL

## Test Specification for REQ-13: Payers Offering Insurance Plans

### 1. Requirement Analysis

* **Testability Assessment**:  Automatic
* **Complexity**: Simple
* **Prerequisites**:
    * A running FHIR server with the payer's data.
    * Valid authentication credentials for the FHIR server.

### 2. Test Implementation Strategy

* **Required FHIR Operations**: 
    * `GET /InsurancePlan` - Search for Insurance Plans offered by the payer.
* **Test Data Requirements**:
    * **Payer Identifier:** A known identifier for the payer (e.g., Payer ID). This could be provided as a test input parameter.
* **Validation Criteria**:
    * **Positive Test Case:** A successful response (`200 OK`) is received from the server.
    * **Positive Test Case:** The response bundle MUST contain at least one `InsurancePlan` resource.
    * **Negative Test Case:** If no `InsurancePlan` resources are found for the payer, the test should fail.

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Test Case: Verify Payer Offers Insurance Plans

# Input: payer_id - Identifier of the payer
def test_payer_offers_insurance_plans(payer_id)
  begin 
    # Establish connection to the FHIR server
    client = FHIR::Client.new('https://your-fhir-server-url') 
    client.use_r4
    client.set_bearer_token('your-bearer-token') # If applicable

    # Search for InsurancePlans offered by the payer
    search_params = {
      'payer': payer_id
    }
    search_response = client.search('InsurancePlan', search: { parameters: search_params })

    # Validate the response
    if search_response.code == 200 && search_response.resource.entry.length > 0
      puts "Test Passed: Payer #{payer_id} offers Insurance Plans."
      return true
    else
      raise "Test Failed: Payer #{payer_id} does not offer any Insurance Plans or an error occurred." 
    end

  rescue => e
    puts "Test Failed: An error occurred - #{e.message}"
    return false
  end
end

# Example Usage
payer_id = "ExamplePayerID123" # Replace with actual payer ID
test_payer_offers_insurance_plans(payer_id) 
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Data Availability:** The test relies on the availability of InsurancePlan resources for the specified payer in the FHIR server. Insufficient test data can lead to false negatives.
* **Payer Identifier Format:** Ensure the test handles different formats of payer identifiers correctly (e.g., UUID, National Payer ID).
* **FHIR Server Performance:**  A large number of InsurancePlans might impact the performance of the search operation. Consider pagination or more specific search criteria for optimization.
* **Security:**  Use proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to access the FHIR server and protect sensitive data.
* **Edge Case - Empty InsurancePlan:** While the requirement states "one or more," consider adding a test case to check if an InsurancePlan with no coverage details is acceptable or should be flagged as a potential data issue.

## Plan-Net InsurancePlan

<a id='req-14'></a>

### REQ-14: Each InsurancePlan shall be associated with one or more Networks.

**Description**: "and each plan is associated with one or more Networks."

**Actor**: Payer

**Conformance**: SHALL

## Test Specification for REQ-14: InsurancePlan Network Association

### 1. Requirement Analysis

- **Testability Assessment:** Automatic
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Prerequisites:**
    - Access to a FHIR server with InsurancePlan resources.
    - Ability to query the FHIR server using the FHIR API.

### 2. Test Implementation Strategy

- **Required FHIR Operations:**
    - `GET /InsurancePlan` - To retrieve InsurancePlan resources.
- **Test Data Requirements:**
    - No specific test data is required. The test will use existing InsurancePlan resources on the server.
- **Validation Criteria:**
    - For each retrieved InsurancePlan resource:
        - **Positive Test Case:** Verify that the `network` element is present and contains at least one reference to a Network resource.
        - **Negative Test Case:** Verify that an error is returned if an InsurancePlan resource does not have a `network` element or if the `network` element is empty.

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Establish connection to the FHIR server
client = FHIR::Client.new('https://your-fhir-server-url')

# Search for all InsurancePlan resources
insurance_plans = client.search(FHIR::InsurancePlan).resource

# Iterate through each InsurancePlan resource
insurance_plans.each do |insurance_plan|
  begin
    # Positive Test Case: Check if the 'network' element exists and is not empty
    if insurance_plan.network.present? && !insurance_plan.network.empty?
      puts "InsurancePlan with ID: #{insurance_plan.id} PASSED validation."
    else
      raise "InsurancePlan with ID: #{insurance_plan.id} FAILED validation. 'network' element is missing or empty."
    end

  rescue Exception => e
    # Handle any errors during validation
    puts "Error validating InsurancePlan with ID: #{insurance_plan.id}: #{e.message}"
  end
end
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

- **Corner Cases:**
    - InsurancePlan with a very large number of associated Networks. This could impact performance and should be tested.
    - InsurancePlan with references to invalid or deleted Network resources. The test should handle these gracefully.
- **Performance Considerations:**
    - Retrieving and validating a large number of InsurancePlan resources could impact performance. Consider using pagination or limiting the number of resources retrieved.
- **Security Considerations:**
    - Ensure that the test script uses appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to access the FHIR server.

This test specification provides a comprehensive approach to verifying the requirement REQ-14. It outlines the necessary steps, data requirements, and validation criteria to ensure that all InsurancePlan resources are associated with at least one Network resource. The provided pseudocode offers a starting point for implementing the test script in Ruby. Remember to adapt the code and address the potential issues and edge cases based on your specific environment and requirements.

    * A valid Practitioner ID.
* **Validation Criteria:**
    * The response should return a 200 OK status code.
    * The returned PractitionerRole resource should contain a `network` element.
    * The `network` element should contain a reference to a valid Network resource.

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Define FHIR server base URL
server_url = 'https://your-fhir-server/fhir'

# Define test data
practitioner_id = '12345' # Replace with actual Practitioner ID

# Create FHIR client
client = FHIR::Client.new(server_url)

# Perform search for PractitionerRole

    puts "Test Failed: Unable to retrieve PractitionerRole. Server returned status code: #{response.code}"
  end
rescue => e
  puts "Test Failed: An error occurred during the test execution: #{e.message}"
end
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Multiple Networks:** The test should be able to handle cases where a Practitioner participates in multiple Networks.
* **Invalid Network Reference:** The test should handle cases where the `network` element references a non-existent or invalid Network resource.
* **Missing `network` Element:** The test should handle cases where the `network` element is missing from the PractitionerRole resource.
* **Performance:** For large datasets, consider optimizing the search query to improve performance.
* **Security:** Ensure that the test script adheres to the security policies of the FHIR server, including authentication and authorization.

* **Prerequisites:**
    * A running FHIR server that implements the SubscriptionTopic resource and the CapabilityStatement SubscriptionTopic Canonical extension as defined in the implementation guide.

### 2. Test Implementation Strategy

* **Required FHIR Operations:**
    * `GET /metadata` - Retrieve the server's CapabilityStatement.

* **Test Data Requirements:** None

* **Validation Criteria:**
    * **Positive Test Case:** The CapabilityStatement's `rest.resource.where(type = 'SubscriptionTopic').supportedProfile` element **SHALL** contain at least one entry.
    * **Positive Test Case:** Each entry in the `supportedProfile` element **SHALL** be a valid canonical URL.
    * **Negative Test Case:** The server **SHALL NOT** advertise non-conformant canonical URLs.

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Configure FHIR client
client = FHIR::Client.new('https://your-fhir-server-url')

# Test Case: Verify advertised SubscriptionTopic canonical URLs

def test_subscription_topic_canonical_urls(client)
  begin
    # Retrieve the server's CapabilityStatement
    capability_statement = client.read(FHIR::CapabilityStatement, nil).resource

    # Find the SubscriptionTopic resource in the CapabilityStatement
    subscription_topic_resource = capability_statement.rest.resource.find do |resource|
      resource.type == 'SubscriptionTopic'
    end

    # Check if SubscriptionTopic resource is found
    raise 'SubscriptionTopic resource not found in CapabilityStatement' unless subscription_topic_resource

    # Extract supported profiles (canonical URLs)

  rescue => e
    puts "Test Failed: #{e.message}"
  end
end

# Execute the test
test_subscription_topic_canonical_urls(client)
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Multiple `rest` entries in CapabilityStatement:** The server might have multiple `rest` entries in the CapabilityStatement. The test should iterate through all entries and validate the `SubscriptionTopic` resource in each.
* **Performance:** Retrieving and parsing the entire CapabilityStatement can be resource-intensive. Consider implementing a targeted query for the `SubscriptionTopic` resource if performance becomes an issue.
* **Security:** Ensure that the test script connects to the FHIR server securely using HTTPS and appropriate authentication mechanisms.
* **Invalid Canonical URLs:** The test should handle cases where the advertised canonical URLs are malformed or point to inaccessible resources. Consider adding checks for URL validity and accessibility.

  # Retrieve a resource with a network element
  response = client.search('Organization', search: { parameters: { _profile: 'YOUR_PROFILE_URL' } }).resource
  
  # Check if the response is successful
  assert response.success?, "Failed to retrieve Organization resource: #{response.code}"

  # Check if the network code is from the specified code system
  network = response.first.network.first
  assert network.code.system == 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/network-type', "Network code system is incorrect: #{network.code.system}"

  puts "Negative Test Case: Invalid network code rejected."
end

# Run the tests
test_valid_network_code(client)
test_invalid_network_code(client)
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Case Sensitivity:** Ensure the code system URL is compared case-sensitively.
* **Code Existence:** The test data should include both existing and non-existent codes within the specified code system to verify the server correctly validates the code itself.
* **Value Sets:** If the implementation uses ValueSets to constrain the allowed codes, the tests should be updated to reflect this and use codes from the ValueSet.
* **Performance:** Consider testing with a large number of resources to assess performance impact.
* **Security:** Ensure test data does not contain sensitive information and that access to the FHIR server is properly secured.

### REQ-03: Prohibit consumer identifying information for content queries.

**Description**: "A conformant Plan-Net service **SHALL NOT** require a directory mobile application to send consumer identifying information in order to query content."

**Actor**: Server

**Conformance**: SHALL NOT

## Test Specification for REQ-03: Prohibit Consumer Identifying Information for Content Queries

### 1. Requirement Analysis

* **Testability Assessment:** Automatic
* **Complexity:** Simple
* **Prerequisites:**
    * A running instance of the Plan-Net FHIR server.
    * A client capable of making FHIR API requests (e.g., Postman, cURL).
    * Test content resources available on the server.

### 2. Test Implementation Strategy

* **Required FHIR Operations:**
    * `GET /{resourceType}?{search-parameters}` (Search operation)
* **Test Data Requirements:**
    * No specific test data is required for this test. The focus is on the absence of consumer identifying information in the request.
* **Validation Criteria:**
    * The server **SHALL NOT** return an error when a search request is made without any consumer identifying information in the query parameters.
    * The server **SHOULD** successfully return relevant resources based on the provided non-identifying search parameters.

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Configure FHIR client
client = FHIR::Client.new('https://plan-net-server.com/fhir')

# Define search parameters (excluding any consumer identifying information)
search_params = {
  'status': 'active'
}

begin
  # Execute the search request
  response = client.search('Coverage', search: search_params)

  # Validate the response
  if response.code == 200
    puts "Test Passed: Content query successful without consumer identifying information."
  else
    raise "Test Failed: Unexpected response code #{response.code}"
  end

rescue => e
  puts "Test Failed: #{e.message}"
end
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Definition of "consumer identifying information":** The requirement does not explicitly define what constitutes "consumer identifying information." The test cases should consider various identifiers like patient IDs, device IDs, or any other information that could potentially identify a consumer.
* **Implicit identification:** The server might infer consumer identity from the context of the request (e.g., authenticated user, request origin). The test cases should consider scenarios where such implicit identification might be possible and ensure it does not influence the content query results.
* **Performance impact:** While this requirement focuses on prohibiting specific information, it's crucial to ensure that excluding this information doesn't negatively impact the performance of legitimate content queries. Performance testing should be conducted to assess the impact.
* **Security considerations:**  While the requirement aims to protect consumer privacy, it's crucial to ensure that excluding identifying information doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities. For instance, verify that unauthorized access to sensitive content is not possible by simply omitting identifying information from the query.

* **Test Data Requirements:**
    * **Valid Resources:**  A set of resources conforming to the Health Plan API profiles with all "Must Support" data elements populated.
    * **Invalid Resources:** (Optional) A set of resources missing one or more "Must Support" data elements.
* **Validation Criteria:**
    * **Positive Test Cases:**
        * Verify that the server returns an HTTP 200 OK status code for successful resource retrieval.
        * Verify that all "Must Support" data elements defined in the FHIR Implementation Guide are present in the returned resource.
    * **Negative Test Cases (Optional):**
        * Verify that the server returns an appropriate error code (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) if a request is made for a resource missing a "Must Support" data element.

### 3. Pseudocode Implementation (Ruby)

```ruby
require 'fhir_client'

# Configure FHIR client
client = FHIR::Client.new('https://your-fhir-server/fhir')

# Define Must Support data elements for the target resource (e.g., Coverage)
must_support_elements = [
  'Coverage.identifier',
  'Coverage.status',
  'Coverage.beneficiary',
  # ... other Must Support elements for Coverage resource
]

# Positive Test Case
def test_must_support_elements_present(client, resource_type, resource_id, must_support_elements)

# Then assert the server returns an appropriate error code
```

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Incomplete Implementation Guide:** The FHIR Implementation Guide might not clearly define all "Must Support" data elements, leading to ambiguity in testing.
* **Resource Variations:** Different resources within the Health Plan API might have different "Must Support" requirements, requiring separate test cases for each.
* **Data Type Validation:** The test should not only check for the presence of elements but also validate their data types and formats according to the FHIR specification and any additional constraints defined in the Implementation Guide.
* **Performance Considerations:**  Retrieving large resources with numerous "Must Support" elements might impact performance. Consider testing with realistic data volumes.
* **Security Considerations:** Ensure that test data does not contain sensitive patient information and that the test environment is appropriately secured.

### 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

* **Resource Validation:** Ensure the test data is valid according to the base FHIR specification and any profiles defined in the Implementation Guide.
* **Value Set Binding:** Verify that the server correctly validates the codes used for `nullFlavor` and `dataAbsentReason` against the appropriate value sets.
* **Error Handling:** Test the server's error handling for invalid or missing reasons for missing data elements. The server should return a clear and informative error message.
* **Performance:** Consider testing with large resources or a high volume of requests to assess the performance impact of validating missing data element reasons.
* **Security:** Ensure that sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed through the use of `dataAbsentReason` extensions. For example, avoid using reasons that might disclose confidential patient information.
