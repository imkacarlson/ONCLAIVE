## Test Plan for Unknown-Unknown

## Test Plan: [FHIR Implementation Guide Name]

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the test plan for validating conformance to the [FHIR Implementation Guide Name] FHIR Implementation Guide (IG). The purpose of this test plan is to ensure that systems implementing this IG adhere to the specified requirements and exchange healthcare information effectively and interoperably. 

**Scope:**

This test plan covers the following aspects of the IG:

* **Resources:** [List all FHIR resources covered by the IG]
* **Profiles:** [List all FHIR profiles defined in the IG]
* **Operations:** [List any specific FHIR operations defined in the IG]
* **Terminology:** [List any specific terminology requirements outlined in the IG]

**Key Testing Considerations:**

* **Conformance to FHIR Standard:** The test plan will verify conformance to the base FHIR specification (e.g., R4B) and any referenced profiles from other IGs.
* **IG Specific Requirements:** The test plan will focus on validating the specific requirements and constraints defined within this IG.
* **Interoperability:**  Testing will include scenarios that simulate real-world data exchange between systems implementing this IG.
* **Security and Privacy:** The test plan will address security and privacy considerations as outlined in the IG and relevant regulations (e.g., HIPAA).

## 2. Test Environment Requirements

**2.1 Infrastructure:**

* **FHIR Server:** A FHIR server compliant with the target FHIR version (e.g., R4B) and capable of loading and serving the IG's profiles and extensions.
* **Testing Tool:** A suitable testing tool capable of executing FHIR requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), validating responses against profiles, and generating test reports. Examples include:
    * **Inferno:** Open-source FHIR testing framework.
    * **Touchstone:** Publicly available FHIR testing platform.
    * **Custom Test Scripts:**  Developed using scripting languages like Python or JavaScript.
* **Test Data:** A set of realistic and synthetic patient data conforming to the IG's requirements. This data can be generated using tools like Synthea or manually crafted.

**2.2 FHIR Server Configuration:**

* The FHIR server must be configured to support the required FHIR resources and operations as defined in the IG.
* The server should be populated with the necessary terminology resources (ValueSets, CodeSystems) referenced by the IG.
* Security configurations should be in place to ensure secure data exchange and access control.

## 3. Test Groupings

This section groups related requirements into logical test categories for efficient testing.

**3.1 Resource Validation:**

* **Test Approach:** This group focuses on validating the structure and content of individual FHIR resources against the profiles defined in the IG.
* **Key Considerations:**
    * Validate mandatory elements and data types.
    * Verify cardinality constraints for elements and extensions.
    * Ensure adherence to specified terminology bindings (ValueSets).
    * Test for valid resource instance creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.

**3.2 Search and Retrieval:**

* **Test Approach:** This group verifies the ability to search and retrieve FHIR resources based on various search parameters defined in the IG.
* **Key Considerations:**
    * Test all supported search parameters and their modifiers.
    * Validate correct response structure and content (Bundle resources).
    * Test for accurate filtering and sorting of results.

**3.3 Operations:**

* **Test Approach:** This group focuses on testing any specific FHIR operations defined in the IG beyond the standard CRUD operations.
* **Key Considerations:**
    * Validate request and response structures for each operation.
    * Test different scenarios and edge cases for each operation.

**3.4 Terminology Conformance:**

* **Test Approach:** This group ensures that the system correctly uses and validates terminology as specified in the IG.
* **Key Considerations:**
    * Validate that coded elements use codes from the designated ValueSets.
    * Test for correct handling of unknown or invalid codes.

## 4. Individual Test Cases

This section provides detailed test cases for each requirement in the IG.

**Requirement ID:** [Requirement ID from the IG]
**Test Case ID:** [Test Case ID, e.g., TC_REQ_<Requirement ID>]
**Preconditions:** [List any preconditions for the test case]
**Test Steps:**
1. [Step 1 with expected result]
2. [Step 2 with expected result]
...
**Validation Criteria:** [Define how to validate the test case's success]

**Example:**

**Requirement ID:** R001 - Patient resources SHALL include an identifier element with a value for the system element.
**Test Case ID:** TC_REQ_R001
**Preconditions:** 
* A FHIR server is running with the IG's profiles loaded.
* Test Patient data is available.
**Test Steps:**
1. **Action:** Send a POST request to the `/Patient` endpoint with a Patient resource that does not include a `system` element within the `identifier`.
2. **Expected Result:** The server should respond with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error. The response body should indicate that the `system` element is required within the `identifier`.
**Validation Criteria:**
* Verify the HTTP status code of the response.
* Verify the content of the response body for the error message.

**For automatically testable requirements, provide pseudocode or test logic outline:**

```python
# Example using Python and the requests library
import requests

def test_patient_identifier_system_required():
  """Tests that the system element is required within the identifier element for Patient resources."""

  # Construct the Patient resource without the system element
  patient_data = {
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "identifier": [
      {
        "value": "12345"
      }
    ]
  }

  # Send the POST request
  response = requests.post("http://fhir-server/Patient", json=patient_data)

  # Assert the response status code and content
  assert response.status_code == 400
  assert "system element is required" in response.text
```

## 5. Special Testing Considerations

**5.1 Edge Cases:**

* **Data Type Limits:** Test with data values at the boundaries of allowed data types (e.g., maximum string length, minimum and maximum dates).
* **Code Validity:** Test with both valid and invalid codes for coded elements to ensure proper validation and error handling.
* **Resource Cardinality:** Test scenarios with minimum and maximum allowed instances of repeating elements or resources.

**5.2 Performance Considerations:**

* **Response Times:** Measure and analyze response times for various operations, especially search operations with large datasets.
* **Resource Size:** Test the impact of large resource instances on system performance.
* **Load Testing:** Simulate real-world load conditions to assess the system's performance under stress.

**5.3 Security Testing:**

* **Authentication and Authorization:** Verify that the system enforces proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing resources.
* **Data Integrity:** Test for vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) to ensure data integrity.
* **Auditing and Logging:** Verify that the system logs security-related events and access attempts.
