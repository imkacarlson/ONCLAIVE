2. `GET [base]/[ResourceType]?[search parameters]`

### Validation Criteria

#### Technical Validation
1. Application successfully processes resources with missing Must Support elements
2. No errors or exceptions occur due to missing elements
3. Application logs or audit trails show correct interpretation

#### Functional Validation
1. Application UI/display:
   - Clearly indicates "data not present" for missing Must Support elements
   - Distinguishes between missing data and null/empty values
   - Maintains consistency in presentation across different resource types

#### Test Pass/Fail Criteria
**Pass if**:
- Application successfully processes resources with missing Must Support elements
- Application correctly interprets missing elements as "data not present"
- No errors occur during processing
- Consistent behavior across all test scenarios

**Fail if**:
- Application throws errors on missing Must Support elements

## 2. Requirement Analysis

### Testability Assessment
- **Classification**: Automatically Testable
- **Rationale**: Can be verified through direct API calls checking for authentication requirements

### Complexity

2. SEARCH operation on a resource type
3. Basic metadata retrieval (capabilities)

### Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Basic Resource Access
```
GET [base]/Organization
Accept: application/fhir+json
```
- Expected: Server responds without authentication challenge
- HTTP Status: 200 OK or 404 Not Found (both indicate no auth required)

#### Test Case 2: Capability Statement Access

- Any valid resource endpoint can be used for verification

### Error Conditions
Document cases where test should fail:
1. Server requires authentication (HTTP 401)
2. Server requires authorization (HTTP 403)
3. Response includes WWW-Authenticate header
4. Response includes security-related error messages

### Notes
- Test should be executed with completely anonymous access (no credentials provided)
- Multiple resource types should be tested to ensure consistent behavior
- Document any optional authentication mechanisms that may be present but not required

### REQ-02: No consumer tracking

**Description**: "Server should not maintain records that associate consumers with their queried entities"

**Actor**: Server

**Conformance**: SHOULD NOT

# Test Specification for REQ-02

## 1. Requirement ID
REQ-02: No consumer tracking

## 2. Requirement Analysis

### Testability Assessment
- **Classification**: Attestation/Inspection Required
- **Rationale**: This requirement involves internal server behavior that cannot be directly observed through external testing. It requires inspection of server implementation and documentation.

### Complexity
- **Level**: Moderate
- **Rationale**: While the concept is straightforward, verifying compliance requires examination of server internals and potentially database structures.

### Prerequisites
- Access to server documentation
- Access to database schema documentation
- Access to server logging configuration
- Administrative access to inspect server implementation details

## 3. Test Implementation Strategy

### Required Inputs
- Test client credentials
- Sample FHIR queries to generate traffic
- Access to server logs and database

### Test Approach

#### Part 1: Documentation Review
1. Review server documentation for:
   - Logging policies
   - Data retention policies
   - Privacy documentation
   - Database schema documentation

#### Part 2: Technical Inspection
1. Examine database schema for:
   - Absence of tables/columns linking consumer identifiers to queries
   - Absence of query history tables with consumer information
   
2. Review server logging configuration:
   - Verify logs don't store consumer-identifying information with query details
   - Check log retention policies

#### Part 3: Implementation Verification
1. Execute sample queries using different consumer identities
2. Inspect:
   - Database contents
   - Server logs
   - Any audit trails
   - Temporary storage
   
### Validation Criteria

To pass, all of the following must be true:

1. Documentation explicitly states no consumer tracking
2. Database schema shows no capability to store consumer-query associations
3. Log files do not contain correlatable consumer-query information
4. No hidden storage mechanisms exist for tracking consumer queries
5. If audit logs exist, they must not enable reconstruction of consumer-query relationships

### Notes
- This is primarily an inspection-based requirement that cannot be automatically tested
- Regular audit may be needed to ensure continued compliance
- Implementation should be reviewed when server updates occur
- Consider privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA) in implementation review
