  - Ensure the server supports the necessary search parameters as per the Capability Statement.

- **Data Setup**:
  - Populate the FHIR server with sample PractitionerRole and OrganizationAffiliation resources that include active practitioners and organizations with appropriate dates.
  - Ensure that the resources have dates that allow for testing of the "active" status based on the current date.

## 3. Test Implementation Strategy

### Required Inputs
- **FHIR Resources**: 
  - PractitionerRole
  - OrganizationAffiliation

- **Expected Outputs**:
  - A list of PractitionerRole resources where the practitioner is active as of the current date.
  - A list of OrganizationAffiliation resources where the organization is active as of the current date.

### Required FHIR Operations
- **API Calls**:
  - Search for active practitioners:
    ```
    GET /PractitionerRole?_include=PractitionerRole:date=ge<current-date>
    ```
  - Search for active organizations:
    ```
    GET /OrganizationAffiliation?_include=OrganizationAffiliation:date=ge<current-date>
    ```

### Validation Criteria
- **Response Validation**:
  - Ensure the HTTP status code is 200 (OK) for both queries.
  - Verify that the returned resources are not empty and contain the expected number of entries.
  - Check that each PractitionerRole resource returned has a date indicating activity on or after the current date.
  - Check that each OrganizationAffiliation resource returned has a date indicating activity on or after the current date.

- **Assertions**:
  - Assert that all returned PractitionerRole resources have a valid practitioner reference.
  - Assert that all returned OrganizationAffiliation resources have a valid organization reference.
  - Validate that the search parameters used are supported as per the Capability Statement.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Test with no active practitioners or organizations to ensure the system returns an empty result set appropriately.
  - Test with boundary dates to ensure the system correctly includes or excludes resources based on the date.

```

This test specification outlines a structured approach to verify the implementation of the requirement to search for active practitioners and organizations using FHIR resources. It includes detailed steps and criteria for validating the system's conformance to the requirement.
