Resources \u2014 The guide utilizes several FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) resources to capture and exchange medication-related information. Some of the key resources include:\n   - MedicationRequest \u2014 Represents a request or an order for a medication to be dispensed or administered to a patient. This resource contains details such as the medication, dosage instructions, dispensing instructions, and prescribing indications.\n   - Medication \u2014 Defines the medication itself, including information such as the medication name, code, strength, and ingredients.\n   - Patient \u2014 Represents the patient for whom the medication management information is being maintained. This resource includes patient demographics and identifiers.\n   - MedicationDispense \u2014 Documents the dispensing of a medication to a patient, including information such as the dispense date, quantity dispensed, and supplying pharmacy.\n   - MedicationStatement \u2014 Captures the patient's self-reported or observed use of a medication, including information such as the medication, the timing of use, and any relevant comments.\n2. Profiles \u2014 Profiles are used in FHIR to constrain and extend the behavior of FHIR resources to meet specific use cases or interoperability needs. The DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide defines several profiles that tailor the behavior of the above resources:\n   - PDexMedicationRequest \u2014 A profile on the MedicationRequest resource that adds specific constraints and extensions to support medication request use cases in the context of patient-centric data exchange.\n   - PDexMedicationDispense \u2014 A profile on the MedicationDispense resource that includes additional extensions to capture dispensing-related information, such as the status of a medication dispense event.\n   - PDexPatient \u2014 A profile on the Patient resource that adds specific extensions relevant to medication management, such as a medication-focused patient identifier.\n\nThese profiles define the specific structure, data elements, extensions, and constraints required for exchanging medication-related information within the context of the DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide. They ensure that systems and organizations implementing the guide use a consistent and interoperable approach to representing and sharing medication data.\n\nOverall, by leveraging the FHIR resources and profiles defined in the DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide, healthcare organizations can exchange patient-centric medication management information in a standardized and structured manner, enabling more effective medication coordination and ensuring better patient care.",
