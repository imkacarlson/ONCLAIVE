<PROMPT>You will be given a task, marked with the <TASK> tag. Each task consists of a section of FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) text, marked with the <TEXT> tag, a question marked with the <QUESTION> tag, and a boolean value marked by the <ANSWER> tag. This boolean value represents the result of an expert determining the best response to the question (marked by the <QUESTION> tag) when only considering the input text (which is marked by the <TEXT> tag).

`SubscriptionTopic` resources contain information that is difficult to model without an appropriate resource to start from. There was an attempt to profile the `Basic` resource with extensions, but the complexity resulted in very low usability. Combined with use-case evaluation indicated that the most urgent and likely support of topic-based subscriptions would be relying on pre-defined topics with fixed canonical URLs (e.g., topics defined by an Implementation Guide), it was decided to leave topic definitions out-of-scope in R4.

In order to allow for discovery of supported subscription topics, this guide defines the [CapabilityStatement SubscriptionTopic Canonical](StructureDefinition-capabilitystatement-subscriptiontopic-canonical.html) extension. The extension allows server implementers to advertise the canonical URLs of topics available to clients and allows clients to see the list of supported topics on a server. The extension is expected to appear, if supported, on the `Subscription` resource entry. Note that servers are NOT required to advertise supported topics via this extension. Supported topics can also be advertised, for example, by the `CapabilityStatement.instantiates` or `CapabilityStatement.implementationGuide` elements of a CapabilityStatement, as defined by another Implementation Guide. Finally, FHIR R4 servers MAY choose to leave topic discovery completely out-of-band and part of other steps, such as registration or integration.

Full definitions of subscription topics are considered out-of-scope for FHIR R4 implementations. Since the full topic definitions are out-of-scope, FHIR R4 servers are not able to support custom topics submitted by clients. If that functionality is required, a server may choose to expose a limited R4B endpoint to enable such support.

Implementers adding server-side support for topic-based subscriptions are encouraged (but not required) to use the R4B or R5 definitions internally, in order to ease the transition to future versions.</TEXT><QUESTION> Does the provided IG text contain at least one specific, testable requirement for a behavior or capability that can be verified through software testing or attestation?

|  | |
| --- | --- |

This Bundle provides an example of an `empty` notification. This `Bundle` is typical of what may be posted to a notification endpoint (e.g., a listening HTTP server, etc.).

### Notes:

In order to satisfy the requirements of a `history` Bundle (specifically `bdl-3` and `bdl-4`), note that `Bundle.entry.request` must exist.

For the status resource (`entry[0]`), the request is filled out to match a request to the `$status` operation.

Since this is an `empty` notification and does not include additional entries, no additional constraints are imposed by `Bundle` requirements.</TEXT><QUESTION> Does the provided IG text contain at least one specific, testable requirement for a behavior or capability that can be verified through software testing or attestation?

In order to claim conformance with this guide, a server:

* SHALL support the `Subscription` resource (read/write).
* SHALL support the `$status` operation on the `Subscription` resource.
* SHOULD support topic discovery via the [CapabilityStatement SubscriptionTopic Canonical](StructureDefinition-capabilitystatement-subscriptiontopic-canonical.html) extension
* SHALL support at least one channel type, and SHOULD include one from this guide
* SHALL support at least one Payload Type

Note that in FHIR R4, there is no representation of Subscription Topics. Detailed discussion can be found on the [Topic-Based Subscription Components](components.html#subscription-topics-in-r4) page.</TEXT><QUESTION> Does the provided IG text contain at least one specific, testable requirement for a behavior or capability that can be verified through software testing or attestation?
