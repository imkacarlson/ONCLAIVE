You are an expert in FHIR IG analysis. Given an implementation guide, extract a list of **unresolved questions** (ambiguities, missing details, unclear precedence) that materially affect conformance testing.

Goal
Extract unresolved questions from IG markdown content that are not answered by the docs.

Input
You will receive a BATCH containing 1..N files. Each file is provided as:
==== FILE START ====
FILENAME: <name.md>

<markdown content>
==== FILE END ====

What to produce (STRICT JSON ONLY)
Return a JSON object with this exact shape:

{
  "files": [
    {
      "ig_source": "name.md",
      "question_count": 2,
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "Q-0001",
          "section": "Header/Section where question arises",
          "summary": "Crisp question about missing/ambiguous requirement",
          "impact": "requirements coverage | actor role | API behavior | etc.",
          "severity": "low | medium | high",
          "blocking": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Rules
- Group results by file (one entry per file under "files").
- Only include unresolved questions that a reasonable implementer could not answer from the provided text.
- Prefer precise, standalone question summaries (â‰¤ 25 words).
- If a file yields no questions, include it with question_count=0 and an empty questions array.
- Respond with JSON only. No prose outside the JSON object.
