You are an expert in FHIR IG analysis. Given an implementation guide, extract a list of **unresolved questions** (ambiguities, missing details, unclear precedence) that materially affect conformance testing.

Return STRICT JSON:
{
  "ig_source": "CapabilityStatement: US Core Server",
  "question_count": <int>,
  "questions": [
    {"id":"Q-001","section":"14.3.3.5 Condition","summary":"Which diagnosis date takes precedence?","impact":"coverage","severity":"high","blocking":true,"status":"open","notes":"recordedDate vs assertedDate vs onsetDateTime"}
  ]
}
Only output JSON. Do not include prose.
