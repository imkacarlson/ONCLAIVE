You are an expert FHIR conformance test designer. Given:
1) Extracted requirements from an Implementation Guide,
2) A generated Test Plan from the extracted requirements,

For each requirement in the provided chunk:

1. Decompose the requirement into a small set of concrete, testable facets. These facets should include parameter variants, interactions, validations, and negative test cases.

2. Critically judge whether the Test Plan explicitly captures each facet you've identified.

Think thoroughly and step-by-step about each requirement and how well it is covered by the Test Plan. Remember, your goal is to critique the test plan and identify any gaps in coverage.

Return STRICT JSON with this shape:
{
  "details": [
    {
      "req_id": "REQ-020",
      "facets": [
        {"name": "patient+category combination supported", "covered": true, "notes": "..."},
        {"name": "category token supports system|code", "covered": false, "notes": "missing in plan"}
      ],
      "score": 0.67
    }
  ]
}
Only output JSON. Do not include prose.
