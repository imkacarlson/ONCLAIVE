<PROMPT>Your task is to extract requirements from a section of FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) text marked with the <TEXT> tag. Each section of text has been determined to contain one or more requirements by another expert LLM. You will be provided examples of similar sections of text from other IGs, as well as the requirement(s) that were extracted from that section of text. Use them as guidance. Mark your response with the <RESPONSE> tag, and include only the extracted requirements, with no other explanation. Provide the extracted requirements as valid JSON objects. <PROMPT>
