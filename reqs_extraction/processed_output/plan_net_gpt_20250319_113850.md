Introduction: 
The following analysis is based on the 'Change History' section of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net (v1.1.0) implementation guide, based on FHIR R4. The changes listed pertain to various aspects of the guide's implementation, including updates to taxonomy codes, adjustments to HealthcareService Delivery Method, changes to Organization.type binding, and more. 

Upon analysis of this content, it is clear that this section does not include specific, testable requirements. Instead, it provides an overview of the changes made in the implementation guide, but does not use imperative language (SHALL, SHOULD, MUST, etc.) or detail explicit requirements for the implementation of these changes. 

Therefore, it is not possible to extract specific, testable requirements from this chunk of the implementation guide in an INCOSE-compliant format.After thoroughly examining the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, it appears there are no specific, testable requirements that can be extracted and formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. 

The content provided is merely an introductory description of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net profiles, without defining any specific system functionality or behavior that can be translated into quantifiable, testable requirements. 

As such, no requirement extraction is possible based on this content segment.
 
More detailed sections of the Implementation Guide, such as those including conformance statements (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.), might provide the necessary specific, testable requirements.## REQ-01

We are analyzing chunk 3 of 4 from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. The content provides descriptions of two resources - 'PlannetHealthcareService' and 'PlannetInsurancePlan'. However, there are no explicit statements using terms like SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., indicating specific, testable requirements. Therefore, no requirements can be extracted from this chunk.

# REQUIREMENTS
No requirements can be extracted from this chunk due to lack of explicit statements indicating specific, testable requirements.Introduction:
This chunk of the PlanNet Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provides information about the various resources such as PlannetLocation, PlannetNetwork, PlannetOrganization, PlannetOrganizationAffiliation, PlannetPractitioner, and PlannetPractitionerRole. These definitions provide a context for the implementation of the FHIR resources. However, this section does not explicitly contain specific, testable requirements expressed using conformance language such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Therefore, no INCOSE-style requirements can be extracted from this chunk. 

Please note that while this section does not contain explicit requirements, the definitions and information provided are essential for understanding the context and application of these resources in a healthcare setting, and will be important for interpreting requirements provided in other sections of the Implementation Guide.Introduction: 
This requirements extraction focuses on the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0, which is based on FHIR R4. The guide is primarily concerned with the implementation of a Payer Network by a health plan. This analysis did not identify any specific, testable requirements within the provided content. 

Requirement Analysis:

**Source**: Disclaimers and Assumptions section

Please note that the absence of additional SHALL, SHOULD, MUST, MAY, REQUIRED etc. statements indicates that no further testable requirements were identified in this chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0.Introduction:
This section provides an analysis of the FHIR Implementation Guide content focusing on the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. The guide is centered on the critical role of provider directories in enabling the identification of individual providers and provider organizations. The guide also outlines the attributes of the providers. The requirements extracted from this guide serve a variety of use cases including patient/payer focus and basic information exchange. The actors addressed in this guide are the Health Plan API Actor and the Application Actor. 

The guide unfortunately does not provide specific, testable requirements in this chunk using statements with SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., hence no specific INCOSE compliant requirements could be extracted.

However, there are some general functionalities stated which could be further refined into testable requirements with additional context and details. For instance, the functionality that the Health Plan API Actor should be able to publish a directory of its provider networks through a FHIR endpoint, and the Application Actor should be able to use this API for providing useful views of the payer's provider networks for end users. These functionalities are currently not in the INCOSE-compliant format and additional specifications are required to make them testable.After analysing the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, no specific, testable requirements can be extracted from this particular chunk. The chunk provided contains only the authors' information, with no statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, or similar. 

Therefore, no INCOSE-compliant requirements can be generated from this chunk.Based on the provided content, no testable requirements were found as per INCOSE standards. The content mainly provides general information about the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide and doesn't contain any statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. 

Therefore, it's not possible to create INCOSE-style requirements extraction from this content.Upon analyzing chunk 2 of 7 from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, it appears the provided content is an Examples Table listing certain ResourceTypes and Profiles. In the context of FHIR, ResourceType refers to the type of resource (Endpoint, HealthcareService etc.), whereas Profiles define specific use-cases.

However, the provided content does not contain explicit requirements, statements, or directives using keywords such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Therefore, it's not possible to extract any specific, testable requirements from this particular segment of the FHIR Implementation Guide following the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. 

Further sections of the guide may contain specific directives or requirements that can be transformed into testable requirements. It is recommended to analyze the complete guide for a comprehensive extraction of requirements.Based on the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, it is not possible to extract specific, testable requirements in an INCOSE-compliant format as no requirements, imperative statements or conformance levels (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc.) were provided in the content. 

The content mainly consists of references to various healthcare services, insurance plans, and locations. While these references might be part of the larger FHIR Implementation Guide, they do not provide the necessary information for extracting specific, testable requirements. 

As a Healthcare Integration Test Engineer, my recommendation would be to review other sections of the FHIR Implementation Guide that contain specific directives, rules, or guidelines for implementing the FHIR standard. These sections are likely to contain the type of requirements that can be extracted and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.# INTRODUCTION

This analysis pertains to the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 chunk 4 of 7, which focuses on several location and organization resources. The resources relate to different clinics, hospital locations, pharmacy locations, and network organizations. The information is presented as links to different resources and their related StructureDefinitions.

After thorough review, no explicit requirements using terms like SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED are found in this chunk of the Implementation Guide. It appears this section is primarily informational, providing links to details about various healthcare locations and organizations.

As such, no testable requirements in INCOSE-compliant format can be extracted from this chunk. Further sections of the Implementation Guide should be reviewed for identifying specific requirements.## REQ-01

Please note that the exact functionality and parameters for the FHIR R4 Organization and PlannetOrganization were not given in this chunk of the Implementation Guide, therefore detailed requirements could not be extracted. For accurate and detailed requirement extraction, the complete specifications of FHIR R4 Organization and PlannetOrganization must be provided.Introduction: 
The provided FHIR Implementation Guide content gives an overview of various organizations' and their affiliations' FHIR resources. However, the content does not explicitly state any specific functional requirements using terms like SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED etc. Therefore, the content does not provide any specific, testable requirements that can be extracted and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. 

It is important to mention that the content provides valuable context and background information related to HartfordOrthopedics, Hospital, PharmChain, BurrClinicAffil, ConnHIEAffil, HamiltonClinicAffil, HartfordOrthopedicAffil organizations and their affiliations.

It should be noted that the actual implementation guide chunk may contain additional requirements not captured in this analysis, depending on the specific content and language of the guide.Based on the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, it seems that there are no specific, testable requirements mentioned in this chunk. There are no statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Also, there are no explicit actors or conformance levels mentioned.

Instead, the content provides a list of FHIR resources (InsurancePlan, Location, Organization, etc.) and their associated properties (administered-by, owned-by, coverage-area, etc.) used in the Plan-Net Implementation. 

However, these lists can be used to create guidelines for testing the correct implementation and integration of these resources in the system. 

The INCOSE Systems Engineering standards specifically require testable requirements in the form of SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED statements, which are not present in this chunk of the Implementation Guide. Therefore, it might not be possible to generate INCOSE-style requirements based on this content. 

Unless additional context or content is provided, we cannot derive specific, testable requirements from this chunk according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.## REQ-01

**Source**: Via Intermediary Section# INTRODUCTION
This chunk from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 focuses on the terminology and value sets used by systems conforming to the implementation guide. The value sets define sets of codes for various aspects like patient acceptance, service accessibility, delivery methods, endpoint connection types, payload types, use cases, and healthcare service categories. 

After a thorough analysis, it has been identified that this chunk does not contain specific, testable requirements as per INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The content mainly provides an overview of the terminology and value sets but does not specify any requirement that needs to be implemented or tested. 

Therefore, there are no requirements to extract from this specific chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide content.The content provided appears to be a list of value sets used in the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. These value sets define categories and standards for various aspects of the health care service and insurance industries. As these are definitions and standards, rather than functional requirements, they do not contain explicit statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., that would typically denote a testable requirement in INCOSE Systems Engineering context. 

Therefore, no testable requirements in INCOSE-compliant format can be extracted from this particular content.Introduction:
The provided FHIR Implementation Guide content appears to be a list of ValueSets from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. These ValueSets represent coded data used in health information systems. The definitions in these ValueSets are used within the FHIR resources to ensure data consistency. However, the provided content does not contain any explicit requirements with conformance language such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED that can be extracted into INCOSE-compliant format. 

Please, provide further content with explicit, testable requirements for proper extraction. As it stands, no requirements can be extracted from the currently provided content.Based on the provided content from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, this section describes the terminology and code systems used by systems conforming to this implementation guide. However, there are no specific, testable requirements identified in this chunk of the implementation guide that can be translated into INCOSE Systems Engineering format. The content is largely descriptive and informational, outlining the types of code systems without specifying any actions, behaviors, or constraints that could be tested. 

As such, no INCOSE-style requirements can be extracted from this content. The performance or behavior of the system is not mandated or described, and no use of imperative language (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc.) is present. This section appears to primarily provide a reference or resource for understanding the code systems used in other parts of the implementation guide.

In the context of system requirements, it's important to note that not every section of a guide or standard will include testable requirements. Some sections, like this one, might provide context or describe concepts essential to the understanding of the requirements outlined elsewhere in the document.Introduction:
This particular chunk from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provides examples of different instances that a system conforming to this guide might produce or consume. However, there are no explicit requirements, conformance directives (such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.), or actions stated in this chunk. 

Therefore, based on this block of text from the Implementation Guide, there are no specific, testable requirements that can be extracted and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. 

This does not mean that no requirements are associated with the example instances mentioned, but simply that they are not articulated in this specific chunk of the Implementation Guide. The associated requirements may be defined in other sections of the Implementation Guide.Based on the content provided, it appears to be a list of HTML pages containing information about different healthcare entities like clinics, hospitals, and healthcare services. This content does not explicitly specify any requirements, guidelines, or conditions as per the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.

Therefore, no specific, testable requirements that can be formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards can be extracted from this content. However, these pages could potentially be useful for deriving functional requirements related to the structure, relationships, and properties of these healthcare entities in the context of a broader system. Further investigation of these pages would be required to identify such requirements.After meticulous analysis of the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, it appears that this particular chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 does not contain any specific, testable requirements that can be extracted and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The given content primarily focuses on different entities such as practitioners, locations, services, and organizations, and their respective roles or affiliations.

However, there are no explicit conditions, obligations, or directives specified for any actor, indicated by words such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED. Therefore, it is not feasible to create INCOSE-style requirements from this chunk.

Further chunks of the FHIR Implementation Guide should be examined in order to generate a comprehensive list of INCOSE-compliant requirements.Introduction:
This chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide seems to provide a list of example resources and their descriptions in the healthcare domain such as Hospitals, Practitioners, their roles, Organizations that provide pharmacy services, their affiliations, healthcare services provided by these organizations, and their locations. However, there are no explicit conditions, rules, or requirements stated that need to be adhered to. Therefore, no requirements can be extracted from this chunk. 

Requirements:

There are no testable requirements in this chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide. It is recommended to review other parts of the guide that contain explicit conditions using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. to find testable requirements.
