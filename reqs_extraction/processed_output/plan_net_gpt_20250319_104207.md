# INTRODUCTION
This section covers the change history of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0 based on FHIR R4. It provides details on the changes made since version 1.0.0. However, after careful review, it is evident that this chunk does not contain specific, testable requirements in the context of INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The included changes are more related to the updates or fixes in the guide rather than specific requirements. 

Therefore, no requirements could be extracted from this specific content chunk.# INTRODUCTION
This requirement analysis focuses on the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net v1.1.0, which is based on FHIR R4. The main purpose of this implementation guide is to outline the necessary specifications for healthcare interoperability.

Upon reviewing this chunk of the Implementation Guide, no specific testable requirement has been identified. The content primarily provides an overview and context of the guide without setting forth any explicit requirements in terms of SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED. Therefore, no requirements are listed in this analysis. Further sections of the guide may contain specific, testable requirements that can be formatted in the INCOSE style. 

This does not necessarily mean the section is irrelevant; it provides important context for understanding the purpose and scope of the implementation guide. However, in terms of INCOSE-compliant requirements, this section does not provide any.## REQ-01

**Notes**: Actor: Client, Conformance: SHALL, Conditional: False
**Source**: Disclaimers and Assumptions SectionIntroduction:
This portion of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provides background information on the use of provider directories and the primary actors involved in this implementation guide. It also provides an overview of the relationships between resources used in the implementation guide. However, this portion does not provide explicit statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Therefore, there are no specific, testable requirements that can be extracted and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards from this particular portion.

Based on the information provided, no specific INCOSE-style requirements can be extracted. The information given mainly provides context and background, and does not define system behaviors, constraints, or performance requirements. There are no direct instructions or specifications that must, shall, or should be met by the system or its components. 

In conclusion, this part of the Implementation Guide content does not contain testable requirements that can be transformed into INCOSE-compliant format.After a thorough analysis of the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, it appears that there are no specific, testable requirements within this chunk. The content provided primarily consists of the author's names and contact information, which does not yield any implementable or testable requirements within the context of INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.

Therefore, no INCOSE-style requirements could be extracted from this particular chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. This conclusion is based on the absence of actionable statements using the keywords SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., that would typically indicate specific requirements within an Implementation Guide.

Further analysis will be required on other sections of the Implementation Guide to extract and format specific, testable requirements according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.Introduction: The content to be analyzed is the "Examples" section from the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net v1.1.0 implementation guide based on FHIR R4. This section does not provide specific directives or requirements in terms of the use of SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED, therefore, no testable requirements can be extracted from this content.

Based on the mentioned content:

```
This page is part of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net (v1.1.0: [STU](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/HL7+Balloting "Standard for Trial-Use") 1) based on [FHIR R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4). This is the current published version. For a full list of available versions, see the [Directory of published versions ![](external.png)](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex-plan-net/history.html)
## Examples
```

No INCOSE-compliant requirements can be extracted from this content. The content seems to be an introductory or contextual information about the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net and does not provide actionable, testable requirements.Introduction: This chunk from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 consists of an examples table that includes various resources and their profiles. There are no explicit requirements stated in this chunk regarding the SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Hence, there is no specific, testable requirement that could be extracted and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. 

Statement: There are no INCOSE-style requirements that can be extracted from the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content.Given that the provided content is a list of links, there is no specific, testable requirement information available to be extracted. The links provided are presumably to various parts of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, which reference different healthcare service implementations (HospERService, PharmChainCompService, etc.) and insurance plans (AcmeQHPBronze, AcmeQHPGold). However, without the actual content of these links, it's impossible to extract any specific, testable requirements. I would need access to the actual content of these sections in order to extract and format INCOSE-compliant requirements.In this chunk, there are references to several locations and organizations, all of which are associated with a specific FHIR resource - either Location or Organization, and a specific StructureDefinition - either PlannetLocation or PlannetNetwork. However, there are no explicit requirement statements using terms like SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc.

Therefore, based on the provided content, it is not possible to extract any specific, testable requirements in the INCOSE Systems Engineering compliant format. The content does not provide any specific actions, conditions, or rules that could form the basis of a requirement. It appears to be more of a listing or cataloging of resources rather than guideline content with specific implementation instructions or requirements. 

For further analysis, more comprehensive and context-rich content from the Plan Net Implementation Guide would be required. This may include details about how these resources are to be used, constraints on their usage, or specific functionality that needs to be implemented.The provided FHIR Implementation Guide content pertains to different types of organizations and their corresponding structure definitions within the Plan Net Implementation Guide. However, no specific, testable requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. are explicitly stated in the provided text. Therefore, it is not possible to extract and format INCOSE-compliant requirements from this particular content.

Please provide further or more specific content from the FHIR Implementation Guide to continue with the extraction and formatting of testable requirements.Introduction:
The given content to be analyzed seems to refer to different types of organizations and affiliations in a healthcare context, specifically as it pertains to the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. However, there are no clear requirements indicated in the provided content.

Based on the provided information, no specific, testable requirements that adhere to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards can be extracted. The information given seems to be a list of references to different organization types and affiliations, but there's no clear instruction or specific requirement related to the implementation or functionality of these references.

Conclusion:
No requirements can be extracted from this chunk as there are no statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Furthermore, there are no clear indications of actions to be taken or functionalities to be implemented. In order to generate INCOSE-compliant requirements, more detailed information or specific instructions on the implementation guide would be needed.## REQ-1

# INTRODUCTION
This analysis focuses on the Value Sets specified in the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. The Value Sets include HealthcareService Types, Individual and Group Specialties, Individual Specialties, Degrees, Licenses, and Certificates, Insurance Plan Types, Insurance Product Types, Language Proficiency, and Minimum Endpoint Connection Types. 

From the content provided, no specific, testable requirements using the key language (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc.) that indicate conformance level are identified. This section rather provides a list of value sets that may be used in the implementation. Therefore, there are no requirements to be extracted in INCOSE-compliant format from this chunk. 

However, please note that these value sets may be used in other sections to define requirements and the analysis of those sections might reveal specific, testable requirements related to these value sets.As a Healthcare Integration Test Engineer, I have analyzed chunk 15 of 20 from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. This section mainly consists of different ValueSets that are used in the FHIR Implementation Guide. However, there are no explicit statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. that could be extracted as specific, testable requirements. 

Based on the provided content, there are no requirements that can be directly inserted into an INCOSE-style Software Requirements Specification. Therefore, no requirements are listed in this analysis. 

Should future versions of this Implementation Guide include explicit statements for these ValueSets, requirements can then be extracted and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.INTRODUCTION

This chunk from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provides a list of various code systems that should be used by systems conforming to this implementation guide. The code systems listed include those used for identifying if a practice is accepting new patients, categories of accommodations available, healthcare service delivery methods, endpoint connection types, payload types, healthcare services categories, insurance plans and products, language proficiency, organization types and affiliations, provider roles, qualification status, and virtual service delivery modalities.

Since the information provided is more of a guide to the code systems to be used, it doesn't include any specific, testable requirements stated in the SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, REQUIRED, or MUST form. Therefore, no INCOSE-style requirements can be extracted from this chunk.

However, for future reference, it would be important to note that any system implementing this guide would need to use these code systems as they are vital in ensuring uniformity and standardization in healthcare data exchange.

If any future sections in the implementation guide refer to these code systems, it would be essential to ensure that the system under test adheres to the code systems as described in this section.Introduction: This chunk from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provides a set of example instances, representing different entities and roles within the healthcare system. While these instances provide useful context and examples of data that might be produced and consumed by systems conforming with this implementation guide, they do not appear to contain any specific, testable requirements. Therefore, no INCOSE-style requirements can be extracted from this chunk.

No specific requirement has been identified in this part of the content. The content mainly describes a list of example instances that show what data produced and consumed by systems conforming with this implementation guide might look like. They are examples of potential data and not explicit requirements for a system.Introduction:
The analyzed content from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 does not contain explicit statements or directives that can be translated into specific, testable requirements. The provided content primarily lists a series of healthcare resources such as clinics, services, practitioners, and affiliations without providing directives in terms of SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Therefore, no INCOSE-compliant requirements can be extracted from this content.

Conclusion:
Given the absence of directives or specific statements that can translate into testable requirements in the content provided, no INCOSE-compliant requirements can be extracted. The content majorly describes healthcare resources without any specific actions or conditions that would constitute a requirement. Therefore, no requirements can be extracted from this content.# INTRODUCTION
This analysis is based on chunk 19 of 20 from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. In this chunk, the content focuses on various healthcare practitioners, locations, services, and affiliations. However, this specific chunk does not provide explicit conformance requirements or statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. The content mostly consists of links to further details about individual practitioners, locations, services, and affiliations. 

# REQUIREMENTS 
Based on the analysis, no specific, testable requirements can be extracted from this chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide content in an INCOSE-compliant format. The content does not provide any clear directives or mandatory actions for actors, thus no testable requirements can be formed.

# CONCLUSION
The analyzed chunk of the Implementation Guide does not contain explicit conformance directives for any actor. It is therefore not possible to extract INCOSE compliant requirements from it. However, the information provided in the links can be useful for understanding the context and may serve as a basis for deriving requirements in future or other sections of the guide.Introduction: This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 does not contain specific, testable requirements written in terms using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Instead, it comprises a list of various Hospitals, Practitioners, Practitioner Roles, Organizations, Organization Affiliations, Healthcare Services, and Locations. Therefore, there are no testable requirements that can be extracted and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards from this particular chunk. All the listed entities are important parts of the FHIR data model and are critical for the proper functioning of the system, but they do not contain explicit conformance directives or requirements.
