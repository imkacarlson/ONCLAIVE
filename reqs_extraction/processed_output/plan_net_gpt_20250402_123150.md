Introduction: 
The given chunk from the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0 provides a change history detailing the modifications made since version v1.0.0. The changes include a variety of updates and fixes, however, no specific, testable requirements using the terms SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., are identified. 

There are no INCOSE-style requirements to be extracted from the provided chunk as it does not contain any specific, testable requirements according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. It is recommended to review other sections of the implementation guide that may contain explicit conformance requirements.Based on the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, it appears that there are no specific, testable requirements to extract from this chunk. The content primarily provides an overview of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net and mentions the current published version and a list of available versions. No statements using the conformance language such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED etc. are present in the provided content, thus no specific requirements can be formulated in INCOSE Systems Engineering standard format. 

Further analysis of the guide, particularly sections providing specific instructions or details about the implementation, is necessary for extracting and formulating specific, testable requirements.## REQ-1

The chunk provided appears to describe two resources from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 - the HealthCareService and the InsurancePlan. Each of these resources provides information about different aspects of healthcare service and insurance plan respectively. However, based on the provided content, there are no explicit testable requirements identified in INCOSE Systems Engineering standards format. 

The provided content does not include directives such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED, which are typically needed to define specific, testable requirements. Instead, the content describes the general purposes and applications of the HealthCareService and InsurancePlan resources.

# REQUIREMENTS
No specific, testable requirements can be extracted from the provided content based on INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The content describes two resources but does not provide any explicit directives or conditions for implementing these resources. 

# CONCLUSION
This analysis does not yield any INCOSE-formatted requirements due to the descriptive nature of the provided content. Future chunks of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 may contain more directive language from which testable requirements can be extracted.Introduction:

The content provided appears to be a series of definitions or descriptions of different FHIR resources (PlanNetLocation, PlanNetNetwork, PlanNetOrganization, PlanNetOrganizationAffiliation, PlanNetPractitioner, PlanNetPractitionerRole) used in the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. These definitions describe what each resource represents in the context of healthcare services, but they do not specify any explicit requirements such as actions to be performed, conditions to be met, or standards to be adhered to. The content does not include concrete conformance language (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc.), which is typically the basis for extracting specific, testable requirements.

Based on the provided content:

This content does not seem to contain any specific, testable requirements that could be extracted and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. Instead, the provided content appears to give a general overview of the functions and roles of various healthcare resources within the PlanNet Implementation Guide.

No requirements were identified in this chunk of content, and hence none can be provided in INCOSE-style format. Please provide more content or specific sections from the FHIR Implementation Guide that contain concrete requirements or conformance statements.Introduction: This analysis focuses on the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0, specifically its home page content. The guide is based on FHIR R4 and provides essential information about the implementation guide's version, its official URL, and its computable name. 

Upon review of the provided content, no specific, testable requirements are identified in this section. The content primarily provides background and introductory information about the implementation guide. 

As per the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards, the requirements should be specific, testable, and complete. Typically, they are expressed using terms like SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. The provided content does not contain any such statements that can be transformed into testable requirements. 

While the content does provide the context for the guide (the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net), it does not set forth any specific requirements for the system to be built or the conditions under which it should operate. Therefore, no requirements can be extracted from this section of the guide. 

Further review of subsequent sections of the guide could provide specific, testable requirements that adhere to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.## REQ-1

**Summary**: Known client endpoint
**Description**: "This implementation guide assumes that the directory endpoint is known to the client."
**Verification**: Test
**Notes**: Actor: Client, Conformance: Implied Requirement
**Source**: Disclaimers and Assumptions

Note: While these are not explicitly stated as requirements in the typical SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED format, they are expectations and assumptions that the implementation guide makes, and are thus treated as requirements for the purposes of this analysis.# INTRODUCTION
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provides a background on the role of provider directories in healthcare and introduces two key actors involved in the implementation of the guide: the Health Plan API Actor and the Application Actor. This chunk also outlines anticipated query use cases and provides an overview of the relationships between resources used in the guide. However, no explicit testable requirements, as defined by the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards, can be identified in this chunk.

Therefore, no requirements extraction has been performed for this chunk. 

The chunk highlights the importance of the provider directories, the roles of different actors, and the relationships between various resources. These details can aid in understanding the context and application of the guide, but don't present explicit, testable requirements.

For future extractions, it is recommended to focus the analysis on sections of the Implementation Guide that contain specific implementation instructions, conformance statements, or explicit requirements. These may typically be found in sections discussing functionality, interfaces, or data models.After carefully analyzing the provided chunk from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, it appears that this section does not contain any specific, testable requirements. The information given is actually the contact details of the authors involved in the creation of the guide, which does not provide any explicit requirements for the functionality, performance, or constraints of the system being designed.

Therefore, in compliance with INCOSE Systems Engineering standards, no requirement extraction can be performed on this section as it does not meet the criteria for defining requirements. For instance, there are no directives or constraints specified using terms like SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc.

In conclusion, this chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 does not provide any INCOSE-compliant, testable requirements.# INTRODUCTION
This analysis focuses on the "Examples" page of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0. This guide is based on FHIR R4. The page does not provide specific requirements but appears to be a placeholder for examples related to the guide. 

As such, there are no specific, testable requirements that can be extracted from this content and formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. 

Please proceed to the next chunk of the Implementation Guide for further requirement extraction and analysis.Introduction: The given chunk from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provides an examples table that lists various resources and their associated profiles. However, the chunk does not contain specific, testable requirements expressed in terms of SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. 

In this context, it's important to note that not all sections of an implementation guide will contain explicit requirements. Some sections, such as the example provided, may serve other purposes such as providing illustrative examples, defining resource types, or outlining specifications.

Given this, no requirement is extracted from this chunk. This does not imply a deficiency in the Implementation Guide, but rather that this specific section is not intended to express testable requirements.The provided content does not provide explicit, testable requirements for the FHIR Implementation Guide. The content shared are links to various healthcare services and insurance plans, which are resources in the FHIR specification but do not contain explicit requirements or directives such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED. It is possible that the actual requirements may be included in the linked pages, however, without access to the content of these links, it's not feasible to extract specific, testable requirements.

Further review of each individual resource type - HealthcareService, InsurancePlan, and Location - and their specific instances may reveal requirements. For a complete and thorough extraction of testable requirements, these resources should be analyzed individually.

As such, no requirements can be extracted for an INCOSE-style Software Requirements Specification from the provided content.The provided FHIR Implementation Guide content does not contain specific, testable requirements with conformance keywords such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. These links refer to different locations and organizations, however, they do not provide specific instructions or requirements for implementation.

Therefore, no INCOSE-compliant requirements can be extracted from this content. Further parts of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 need to be analyzed to extract specific, testable requirements in INCOSE-compliant format.Introduction: This chunk from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provides a list of organizations each linked to its respective FHIR resource and StructureDefinition. However, it does not contain explicit statements using the terms SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Therefore, it does not present directly testable requirements in the context of a typical INCOSE Systems Engineering analysis.

Based on the provided content, we can't generate any specific INCOSE-style requirements as there are no explicit conformance or behavioural requirements stated for any actor. The content mainly provides reference to different organizations and their corresponding FHIR resources and StructureDefinitions.

Therefore, we can conclude that no specific, testable requirements according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards can be extracted from this specific chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0.Based on the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, there are no explicit testable requirements that can be extracted. The content provided includes several references to organizations and affiliations, but no explicit statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., which would indicate a specific, testable requirement. As such, there are no requirements to format according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards in this scenario.

However, it can be noted that for future reference, in the event of encountering explicit requirements, they would be extracted and formatted following the guidelines provided.I'm sorry, but without the actual content from the FHIR Implementation Guide, I am unable to extract specific, testable requirements. The information provided only gives URLs to various pages, but does not provide the actual content from these pages. Please provide the content from these pages for further analysis.## REQ-1

Note: If there are no requirements listed above, that indicates there were no specific, testable requirements found in this chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide for Plan Net.After analyzing the provided chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, it is clear that it does not contain any specific, testable requirements. The content primarily offers definitions and descriptions of the HealthcareService and InsurancePlan resources. These descriptions detail what the resources represent and how they could be used, but they do not include explicit directives or mandates (i.e. statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc.) that would constitute testable requirements. 

Therefore, it is not possible to extract any INCOSE-compliant requirements from this content. The information provided would be useful in understanding the context and purpose of these resources within the healthcare system, which could inform the development of requirements in other sections of the Implementation Guide. However, as it stands, this content does not provide the necessary specificity for requirement extraction.# INTRODUCTION
The provided FHIR Implementation Guide content provides details about the Plan-Net Location, Plan-Net Network, Plan-Net Organization, Plan-Net OrganizationAffiliation, Plan-Net Practitioner, and Plan-Net PractitionerRole. These resources are integral components in the health care provision landscape. However, after careful review, no specific, testable requirements have been identified in this chunk of the Implementation Guide. 

The content mainly offers descriptive information about different resources and their roles in the healthcare system. For instance, a Location is described as the physical place where healthcare services are provided, and a Network is described as an aggregation of organizations and individuals that deliver a set of services across a geography through health insurance products/plans.

Although this content is informative, it does not provide explicit instructions or requirements for how these resources should be implemented or interact with each other. Therefore, it is not possible to extract specific, INCOSE-compliant requirements from this text. 

Further sections of the Implementation Guide may provide the necessary details to establish such requirements.## REQ-01

This chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide content provides detailed information about different types of ValueSets related to healthcare services, individual and group specialties, insurance plans and products, language proficiency, and endpoint connection types. However, this chunk does not contain specific, testable requirements that can be formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.

This analysis has resulted in the following conclusion:

There are no specific, testable requirements that can be extracted from this chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide content. The content primarily consists of explanations and definitions of various ValueSets related to healthcare services, specialties, insurance plans and products, language proficiency, and endpoint connections. These definitions and explanations do not impose requirements on the system or its actors, and thus cannot be formatted into testable requirements according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.Based on the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, it appears that most of the information relates to different ValueSet definitions such as Network Type VS, Non-Individual Specialties, Organization Type VS, etc.

However, this chunk does not contain explicit directives or requirements specified using keywords such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED etc. Therefore, it is not possible to derive specific, testable requirements from this section in an INCOSE-compliant format. 

The mentioned ValueSets seem to provide definitions and categorizations that are expected to be used in the system, but without context or directives, these cannot be translated into specific requirements. 

Further analysis of other sections of the FHIR Implementation Guide might provide the necessary context or directives that would allow for the extraction of INCOSE-compliant requirements.## REQ-1
