Introduction:
This analysis covers the Change History and Profiles sections of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0. These sections primarily contain metadata, version history, and profile definitions. While they provide important context for the implementation guide, they do not contain explicit, testable requirements in the format we're looking for.

After careful examination of the provided content, I have not identified any specific, testable requirements that can be formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The information presented is primarily descriptive and does not include statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED that would indicate explicit requirements.

The Profiles section does list various FHIR profiles defined in this Implementation Guide, but it does not provide specific requirements for their implementation. Instead, it offers brief descriptions of each profile and its base resource.

If you need requirements extracted from this Implementation Guide, we should focus on other sections that contain more prescriptive content, such as those detailing specific conformance criteria or implementation instructions.Introduction:
This chunk contains the introductory content for the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0. While it provides valuable context and background information, it does not contain specific, testable requirements in the format we're looking for. The content primarily describes the purpose, scope, and relationships of the implementation guide without using normative language (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.) that typically indicates requirements.

After careful analysis, I have not identified any specific, testable requirements in this introductory chunk that can be formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards as requested. The text is primarily informative and descriptive, explaining the context and purpose of the implementation guide rather than stating specific technical requirements.

If you would like me to extract any particular information or summarize key points from this introduction, please let me know, and I'd be happy to do so. For extracting actual requirements, we would need to analyze subsequent sections of the implementation guide that contain more technical and normative content.Introduction:
This chunk from the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 appears to be an introductory section for the Examples page. It does not contain any specific, testable requirements. The content primarily provides context about the version and status of the implementation guide.

After careful analysis, I can confirm that there are no extractable requirements in this chunk that meet the criteria for INCOSE-style requirements. The text does not include any statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, or similar directive language that would indicate specific implementation requirements.

The content is informational in nature, providing details about the version and status of the implementation guide. It does not prescribe any actions or behaviors for implementers or systems.

If you have additional chunks of the implementation guide that may contain more detailed specifications or requirements, I would be happy to analyze those for extractable, testable requirements in the INCOSE format.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 contains an Examples Table that lists various resources and their corresponding profiles. While this table provides valuable information about the structure and organization of the implementation guide, it does not contain explicit, testable requirements in the format we're looking for (using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.).

After careful analysis, I have not identified any specific, testable requirements that can be formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards from this content. The table primarily serves as a reference for the examples used in the implementation guide, showing the relationship between resource types and their associated profiles.

If there were requirements to be extracted from this section, they would likely relate to the conformance of these examples to their respective profiles. However, without explicit statements about conformance or implementation requirements, we cannot formulate INCOSE-style requirements from this content alone.

For a comprehensive set of requirements, it would be necessary to analyze the actual content of the referenced resources and profiles, as well as any accompanying narrative text that might contain conformance statements or implementation guidance.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 contains example resources for various FHIR profiles including Location, Organization, OrganizationAffiliation, Practitioner, and PractitionerRole. While these examples are valuable for understanding the implementation of the profiles, they do not contain explicit testable requirements. Instead, they serve as reference implementations and demonstrations of how the profiles should be used.

After careful analysis of the provided content, I have not found any explicit, testable requirements that can be formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The content primarily consists of example resources and links to profile definitions, which do not contain SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED statements that could be translated into specific requirements.

To extract testable requirements for this implementation guide, it would be necessary to analyze the actual profile definitions (e.g., PlannetLocation, PlannetNetwork, PlannetOrganization, etc.) and any accompanying documentation that describes conformance criteria or implementation expectations. These would typically be found in other sections of the implementation guide, such as the profile definitions themselves or in dedicated conformance or implementation guidance sections.

If you need specific requirements related to these resources and profiles, I recommend examining the full implementation guide, particularly the sections that define the profiles and any associated implementation notes or conformance statements.## REQ-1

**Summary**: Implement Plan-Net CapabilityStatement for provider directory access
**Description**: "Systems implementing this capability statement should meet the CMS FInal Rule requirement for provider directory access."
**Verification**: Test
**Notes**: Actor: Server, Conformance: SHOULD, Conditional: False
**Source**: Artifacts Summary, Behavior: Capability Statements section

This requirement suggests that servers implementing the Plan-Net CapabilityStatement should ensure compliance with the CMS Final Rule for provider directory access. While the conformance level is "should," which is not as strong as "shall," it still indicates an important expectation for systems aiming to conform to this implementation guide.

No other explicit requirements were identified in this chunk of the implementation guide. The rest of the content provides an overview of the guide's structure and the types of artifacts it contains, without specifying testable requirements.Introduction:
This section of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 focuses on Search Parameters, which define the properties by which a RESTful server can be searched. These parameters are also used for sorting and including related resources. While this section provides valuable information about the available search parameters, it does not contain explicit, testable requirements in the form of SHALL, SHOULD, or MAY statements.

After careful analysis, I have not identified any specific, testable requirements in this chunk that conform to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards as requested. The content primarily lists and briefly describes various search parameters for different resources such as Endpoint, HealthcareService, InsurancePlan, and Location.

If requirements related to the implementation or support of these search parameters exist, they would likely be found in other sections of the Implementation Guide that discuss conformance criteria or server capabilities.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 contains a list of search parameters for various FHIR resources used in healthcare provider directories. While these search parameters are important for implementing search functionality, they do not explicitly state requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, or similar terms. Instead, they define the capabilities that should be available for searching different resources.

Given the nature of this content, there are no explicit, testable requirements that can be directly extracted and formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards as requested. The search parameters listed provide guidance on how to implement search functionality for different resources, but they do not mandate specific behaviors or conformance levels.

If requirements were to be derived from this information, they would need to be inferred based on the expected implementation of these search parameters. However, without explicit statements of conformance or mandatory behavior, such inferences would not meet the criteria for precise, testable requirements as specified in the task guidelines.

Therefore, I cannot provide INCOSE-formatted requirements for this particular chunk of the Implementation Guide. The content is informative rather than normative in nature, describing available search capabilities rather than stating specific requirements.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 describes various resource profiles and extension definitions. While it provides valuable information about the structure and content of these resources and extensions, it does not contain explicit, testable requirements using normative language (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.). Instead, it serves as a reference for the available resources and extensions within the implementation guide.

As there are no explicit, testable requirements in this chunk, I cannot extract and format requirements according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The content primarily consists of descriptive information about the resources and extensions, without specifying conformance criteria or implementation requirements.

If you need requirements related to these resources and extensions, it would be necessary to analyze other sections of the implementation guide that may contain normative statements about their usage, constraints, or implementation details.## REQ-1

**Summary**: Support specified Value Sets
**Description**: "Systems conforming to this implementation guide shall support the Value Sets defined in the Terminology section."

**Summary**: Implement defined Code Systems
**Description**: "Systems conforming to this implementation guide shall implement the Code Systems defined in the Terminology section."
**Verification**: Test
**Notes**: Actor: Conforming Systems, Conformance: SHALL, Conditional: False
**Source**: Terminology: Code Systems section

These requirements are inferred from the content and structure of the Implementation Guide, rather than being explicitly stated. They reflect the expectation that conforming systems will use the specified terminology resources. For more specific, testable requirements, we would need to analyze how these terminology resources are used in the context of the profiles and other parts of the Implementation Guide.Introduction:
This chunk contains example instances of various FHIR resources that conform to the Plan Net Implementation Guide. While these examples are valuable for understanding the structure and content of the resources, they do not contain explicit, testable requirements. Instead, they serve as reference implementations that demonstrate how the requirements specified elsewhere in the guide should be applied.

After careful analysis, I have not found any explicit, testable requirements in this chunk that can be formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The content primarily consists of links to example resources, which are meant to illustrate the practical application of the implementation guide rather than define new requirements.

If requirements are needed for these example instances, they would typically be derived from the structural and content rules defined in other sections of the implementation guide, such as profile definitions, terminology bindings, and conformance statements.
