    "    return f\"\"\"You are a Healthcare Integration Test Engineer analyzing a FHIR Implementation Guide to extract precise, testable requirements. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Analyze and extract requirements from the below component of a FHIR implementation guide. Requirements are statements that use the following verbs (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, Required, Optional, Must, etc). \n",
    "For each requirement please provide: \n",
    "1. Actor (client/server) \n",
    "2. Conformance level (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, Required, Optional, Must, etc) \n",
    "3. Requirement description \n",
    "4. Source URL/reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY PRINCIPLES:\n",
    "- You should identify between 15 and 50 requirements, maximum, across the entire IG. Therefore, be judicious in what you include as a requirement from each chunk. Do not include examples or general implementation guidance as requirements.\n",
    "- Each requirement must be complete and atomic (verifying a single, testable behavior)\n",
    "- Requirements must be direct quotes with necessary context preserved\n",
    "- Compound \"and\" requirements should be split; \"or\" requirements should stay together\n",
    "- Preserve original conformance levels (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.)\n",
    "- Identify the specific actor(s) responsible for each requirement\n",
    "- Note conditional relationships between requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "REQUIREMENT EXTRACTION RULES:\n",
    "1. REQUIREMENT TEXT\n",
    "   - Use exact quotes from the source text\n",
    "   - Add clarifying context in square brackets [like this]\n",
    "   - Use ellipsis (...) to show removed text within quotes\n",
    "   - Avoid rephrasing or summarizing - use the original text as much as possible\n",
    "   - For compound \"and\" requirements, split into separate atomic requirements while maintaining context\n",
    "   - Keep compound \"or\" requirements as single requirements\n",
    "   - Use markdown formatting for code blocks, italics, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ACTORS\n",
    "   - Identify explicit actors from the text\n",
    "   - For implicit actors, determine from context which system/role must implement the requirement\n",
    "   - Multiple actors only allowed if verification steps would be identical\n",
    "   - If verification differs by actor, create separate requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CONFORMANCE & CONDITIONS\n",
    "   - Record the explicit conformance verb (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.)\n",
    "   - If no explicit verb exists, infer from context\n",
    "   - Mark requirements as conditional if they depend on optional features or choices\n",
    "   - Note relationships between requirements (e.g., MAY X with SHALL Y if X implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. SOURCE TRACEABILITY  \n",
    "   - Provide specific section references\n",
    "   - For duplicate requirements, list all source locations\n",
    "   - Include contextual description of where requirement appears\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of requirements from another IG include the following:\n",
    "1) In order to allow for discovery of supported subscription topics, this guide defines the CapabilityStatement SubscriptionTopic Canonical extension. The extension allows server implementers to advertise the canonical URLs of topics available to clients and allows clients to see the list of supported topics on a server. The extension is expected to appear, if supported, on the Subscription resource entry. Note that servers are NOT required to advertise supported topics via this extension.\n",
    "2) Supported topics can also be advertised, for example, by the CapabilityStatement.instantiates or CapabilityStatement.implementationGuide elements of a CapabilityStatement, as defined by another Implementation Guide.\n",
    "3) FHIR R4 servers MAY choose to leave topic discovery completely out-of-band and part of other steps, such as registration or integration.\n",
    "4) In order to promote widespread compatibility, cross version extensions SHOULD NOT be used on R4 subscriptions to describe any elements also described by this guide\n",
    "5) Note that subscription notifications, by default, are made using the same FHIR version as the server. The Subscription.channel.payload element can be used to specify a different FHIR version, using syntax and values defined by the MIME Type Parameter. Servers SHALL look for this parameter during subscription negotiation and SHALL not accept requests for notification FHIR versions it cannot support (servers MAY reject or coerce, according to their policies).\n",
    "6) The content-type of the POST SHALL match the MIME type on the Subscription (Subscription.channel.payload).\n",
    "7) In addition to the Subscription Status information, each notification MAY include additional resources or references to resources (URLs or ids).\n",

Publication of this data through a standard FHIR-based API will enable third parties to develop applications through which consumers and providers can query the participants in a payer’s network that may provide services that address their health care needs. Although there are multiple types and sources of providers’ directories, including provider organizations (i.e., a hospital listing all its physicians), government (i.e., listing of providers in Medicare), payers (i.e., a health plan’s provider network), and third-party entities (such as vendors that maintain provider directories), the focus of this implementation guide is on Payer Provider Directories.\\nThe PDEX Payer Network (or Plan-Net) Implementation Guide is based conceptually on the [Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide (VHDir IG)](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vhdir/2018Sep/index.html), an international standard. The VHDir IG is based on [FHIR Version 4.0](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html). It was developed in cooperation with the [Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)](http://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/about-onc) and [Federal Health Architecture (FHA)](https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/federal-health-architecture-fha) with guidance from HL7 International, the Patient Administration Workgroup, and the HL7 US Realm Steering Committee.\\nThe use of VhDir as the conceptual base for the profiles and extensions in the PDEX Payer Network Implementation Guide is intended to protect implementers of the Plan-Net IG from rework/remapping when the VHDir concept reaches implementation, and becomes a source of data for the PDEX Payer Network. The primary changes from the VHDir IG are to:\\n1. remove the validation and restriction resources\\n2. use US Core for R4 as the base suite of profiles where possible\\n3. eliminate extensions that are not necessary for this use case\\n4. introduce additional constraints (e.g. search criteria, cardinality, value-set bindings and MustSupport) where appropriate.\\nThe diagram below depicts the scope of this implementation guide (IG). The IG defines the API that exposes a payer’s provider network (including pharmacy locations where appropriate) for access by a consumer or provider application. This is a query only API (GET) and does not support PUT or POST.\\n![](Bob3.png)'}], 'model': 'gpt-4', 'max_tokens': 2048, 'temperature': 0.7}}\n",

The PractitionerRole profile from US Core was not used because it is over-constrained for use in a Provider Directory based on Payer information. The Network profile is based on USCore Organization, since there was no contradiction between the USCore profile and the Plan-Net requirements. However, the NPI and CLIA identifier types, which are Must-Support, are clearly intended for provider organizations only and are not expected to be populated for other organization types. Alignment with VhDir is maintained by adapting VhDir content, where possible.\\n#### Disclaimers and Assumptions\\n* **PDEX Payer Network is based conceptually on VhDir**: The PDEX Payer Network implementation guide is based conceptually on the VhDir implementation guide, which is still a work in progress. Plan-net will need to track changes to VhDir to fulfill its goal of minimizing rework.\\n* **The PDEX Payer Network endpoint is known to the client**: This implementation guide assumes that the directory endpoint is known to the client. There is an overarching system architecture issue that is critical to resolve -- how does the client discover the FHIR endpoint of interest. For the purposes of this IG, we consider that problem out of scope.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4', 'max_tokens': 2048, 'temperature': 0.7}}\n",

Provider directories support a variety of use cases, including:\\n* Patient/Payer focused\\n+ Find provider accessibility information (specialty, office hours, languages spoken, taking patients) - enables individuals and consumers to find contact and other accessibility information for individual healthcare providers and/or healthcare organizations\\n+ Relationship between provider and insurance plan (insurance accepted) or plan and provider (network) - enables individual healthcare providers, organizations, and payers to discover the relationships between providers, organizations, and payers, as well as additional details about the relationships and entities involved\\n* Basic Information Exchange\\n+ Enable electronic exchange (e.g. discovery of electronic endpoints such as IHE/EHR endpoints, FHIR server URLs, Direct addresses) - enables the electronic exchange of health information by supporting the ability to discover electronic service information including electronic endpoints or electronic addresses\\n+ Find an individual and/or organization (even if no electronic endpoint is available) - enables users to find contact and other identifying information about healthcare organizations and individual healthcare providers\\nThis IG addresses two actors:\\n* Health Plan API Actor: A payer publishing a directory of its provider networks through a FHIR endpoint.\\n* Application Actor: A third party using the API published by a payer to provide useful views of the payer\\'s provider networks for end users.\\nFor anticipated query use cases, please see [Representing and Searching Provider Data](implementation.html#Representing).\\n#### Overview of Payer Directory - Resource Relationships\\nNote: the following diagrams provide a high-level view of the relationships between resources used in this IG. They do not necessarily reflect all of the relationships/references between resources.\\n![Key Relationships Among Payer Directory Resources](Slide2.png)\\n![Relationships Between Payer Directory Resources -- Endpoints](Slide3.png)\\n#### Credits\\nThis IG was developed by the MITRE Corporation under the direction of the authors using [FHIR Shorthand syntax](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/) and the [SUSHI tookit](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi), a free, open source toolchain from the MITRE Corporation. Generous guidance on FHIR Shorthand and SUSHI was provided by Chris Moesel. The capability statements were developed with support of tools and generous guidance from Eric Haas, and benefited from critical review by Yengibar Manasyan.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4', 'max_tokens': 2048, 'temperature': 0.7}}\n",

HealthcareServices are typically provided by an organization, except in the case of a Practitioner that is not associated with an organization (see the solo practitioner example), and can be linked to a set of locations where service is provided, or identified as virtual services through an indicated set of virtual modalities.   The examples illustrate this with an organization that provides three distinct Pharmacy services -- retail, compounding, and mail-order -- across its locations.  All organizations that provide service should define an appropriate set. of HealthcareServices to facilitate search.  The HealthcareService category, specialty and type fields are the highest level of organization of the services provided by the provider\\'s network.\\nRelevant examples:\\nScenario   Example Instances\\nRetail Pharmacy Chain   [PharmChainRetailService](HealthcareService-PharmChainRetailService.html \"HealthcareService/PharmChainRetailService\")\\nCompounding Pharmacy   [PharmChainCompService](HealthcareService-PharmChainCompService.html \"HealthcareService/PharmChainCompService\")\\nMail Order Pharmacy (virtual service with no physical location)   [PharmChainMailService](HealthcareService-PharmChainMailService.html \"HealthcareService/PharmChainMailService\")\\nProvider Group   [HartfordOrthopedicServices](HealthcareService-HartfordOrthopedicServices.html \"HealthcareService/HartfordOrthopedicServices\")\\nEmergency Room   [HospERService](HealthcareService-HospERService.html \"HealthcareService/HospERService\")\\nCancer Clinic   [CancerClinicService](HealthcareService-CancerClinicService.html \"HealthcareService/CancerClinicService\")\\nVirtual Counseling Service   [VirtualCounselService](HealthcareService-VirtualCounselService.html)\\nSolo Family Practitioner   [HansSoloService](HealthcareService-HansSoloService.html)'}], 'model': 'gpt-4', 'max_tokens': 2048, 'temperature': 0.7}}\n",

Practitioners and Organizations indicate participation in a Network with a link to the Network using a PractitionerRole or OrganizationAffiliation instance, respectively.   PractitionerRole and OrganizationAffiliation instances are what tie Practitioners and Organizations to HealthcareServices, Organizations, Networks and Locations.\\nThe examples demonstrate the use of the InsurancePlan profile to represent two distinct Qualified Health Plan products covering the state of Connecticut, using a pair of Networks.  The practitioners and organizations in the examples participate in one or both of these networks.\\nRelevant examples:\\nScenario   Example Instances\\nInsurance Company   [Acme](Organization-Acme.html \"Organization/Acme\")\\nQHP Gold Plan with two networks   [AcmeQHPGold](InsurancePlan-AcmeQHPGold.html \"InsurancePlan/AcmeQHPGold\")\\nQHP Bronze plan with one network   [AcmeQHPBronze](InsurancePlan-AcmeQHPBronze.html \"InsurancePlan/AcmeQHPBronze\")\\nStandard Network   [AcmeofCTStdNet](Organization-AcmeofCTStdNet.html \"Organization/AcmeofCTStdNet\")\\nPremium Network   [AcmeofCTPremNet](Organization-AcmeofCTPremNet.html \"Organization/AcmeofCTPremNet\")\\n#### Location\\nLocation instances provide information about location where service is provided, including contact information, address, accessibility, hours of operation and contact, as well as position (lattitude and longitude).   Locations can also be used to represent regions using an associated or attached GeoJSON object.\\nRelevant examples:\\nScenario   Example Instances\\nHospital Location #1   [HospLoc1](Location-HospLoc1.html \"Location/HospLoc1\")\\nHospital Location #2   [HospLoc2](Location-HospLoc2.html \"Location/HospLoc2\")\\nPharmacy Location #1 .

Organization Affiliation instances describe a role, and link a participating organization that provides or performs the role, with an organization where that role is available, and also links the participating organization to a HealthcareServices and networks.  OrganizationalAffiliation can also be used to associate a HealthcareService provided by an organization with networks.\\nScenario   Example Instances\\nPharmacy services are associated with a specific provider network   [PharmChain](Organization-PharmChain.html \"Organization/PharmChain\"), [PharmChainAffil1](OrganizationAffiliation-PharmChainAffil1.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/PharmChainAffil1\"), [PharmChainAffil1](OrganizationAffiliation-PharmChainAffil2.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/PharmChainAffil2\"), [PharmChainAffil1](OrganizationAffiliation-PharmChainAffil3.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/PharmChainAffil3\")\\nClinic Providing Service to a Hospital   [BurrClinic](Organization-BurrClinic.html \"Organization/BurrClinic\"), [BurrClinicAffil,](OrganizationAffiliation-BurrClinicAffil.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/BurrClinicAffil\")[Hospital](Organization-Hospital.html \"Organization/Hospital\")\\nClinic that is part of a Hospital   [HamiltonClinic](Organization-HamiltonClinic.html \"Organization/HamiltonClinic\"), [HamiltonClinicAffil,](OrganizationAffiliation-HamiltonClinicAffil.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/HamiltonClinicAffil\")[Hospital](Organization-Hospital.html \"Organization/Hospital\")\\nSpecialty group providing service to a network at hospital   [HartfordOrthopedics](Organization-HartfordOrthopedics.html \"Organization/HartfordOrthopedics\"), [HartfordOrthopedicAffil,](OrganizationAffiliation-HartfordOrthopedicAffil.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/HartfordOrthopedicAffil\")[Hospital](Organization-Hospital.html \"Organization/Hospital\")\\nClinic that is a member of a regional HIE   [BurrClinic](Organization-BurrClinic.html \"Organization/BurrClinic\"), [ConnHIE](Organization-ConnHIE.html \"Organization/ConnHIE\"), [ConnHIEAffil](OrganizationAffiliation-ConnHIEAffil.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/ConnHIEAffil\")\\n#### Endpoints\\nAn Endpoint instance provides  technical details of an endpoint that can be used for electronic services, such as a portal or FHIR REST services, messaging or operations, or DIRECT messaging.\\nScenario   Example Instances\\nPayer Portal   [AcmeOfCTPortalEndpoint](Endpoint-AcmeOfCTPortalEndpoint.html \"Endpoint/AcmeOfCTPortalEndpoint\")'}], 'model': 'gpt-4', 'max_tokens': 2048, 'temperature': 0.7}}\n",

Requirements are statements that use the following verbs (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, Required, Optional, Must, etc). \\nFor each requirement please provide: \\n1. Actor (client/server) \\n2. Conformance level (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, Required, Optional, Must, etc) \\n3. Requirement description \\n4. Source URL/reference. \\n\\nFollow these guidelines:\\n\\nKEY PRINCIPLES:\\n- You should identify between 15 and 50 requirements, maximum, across the entire IG. Therefore, be judicious in what you include as a requirement from each chunk. Do not include examples or general implementation guidance as requirements.\\n- Each requirement must be complete and atomic (verifying a single, testable behavior)\\n- Requirements must be direct quotes with necessary context preserved\\n- Compound \"and\" requirements should be split; \"or\" requirements should stay together\\n- Preserve original conformance levels (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.)\\n- Identify the specific actor(s) responsible for each requirement\\n- Note conditional relationships between requirements\\n\\nREQUIREMENT EXTRACTION RULES:\\n1. REQUIREMENT TEXT\\n   - Use exact quotes from the source text\\n   - Add clarifying context in square brackets [like this]\\n   - Use ellipsis (...) to show removed text within quotes\\n   - Avoid rephrasing or summarizing - use the original text as much as possible\\n   - For compound \"and\" requirements, split into separate atomic requirements while maintaining context\\n   - Keep compound \"or\" requirements as single requirements\\n   - Use markdown formatting for code blocks, italics, etc.\\n\\n2. ACTORS\\n   - Identify explicit actors from the text\\n   - For implicit actors, determine from context which system/role must implement the requirement\\n   - Multiple actors only allowed if verification steps would be identical\\n   - If verification differs by actor, create separate requirements\\n\\n3. CONFORMANCE & CONDITIONS\\n   - Record the explicit conformance verb (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.)\\n   - If no explicit verb exists, infer from context\\n   - Mark requirements as conditional if they depend on optional features or choices\\n   - Note relationships between requirements (e.g., MAY X with SHALL Y if X implemented)\\n\\n4. SOURCE TRACEABILITY  \\n   - Provide specific section references\\n   - For duplicate requirements, list all source locations\\n   - Include contextual description of where requirement appears\\n\\nExamples of requirements from another IG include the following:\\n1) In order to allow for discovery of supported subscription topics, this guide defines the\\xa0CapabilityStatement SubscriptionTopic Canonical\\xa0extension. The extension allows server implementers to advertise the canonical URLs of topics available to clients and allows clients to see the list of supported topics on a server. The extension is expected to appear, if supported, on the\\xa0Subscription\\xa0resource entry. Note that servers are NOT required to advertise supported topics via this extension.\\n2) Supported topics can also be advertised, for example, by the CapabilityStatement.instantiates or CapabilityStatement.implementationGuide elements of a CapabilityStatement, as defined by another Implementation Guide.\\n3) FHIR R4 servers MAY choose to leave topic discovery completely out-of-band and part of other steps, such as registration or integration.\\n4) In order to promote widespread compatibility, cross version extensions SHOULD NOT be used on R4 subscriptions to describe any elements also described by this guide\\n5) Note that subscription notifications, by default, are made using the same FHIR version as the server. The Subscription.channel.payload element can be used to specify a different FHIR version, using syntax and values defined by the MIME Type Parameter. Servers SHALL look for this parameter during subscription negotiation and SHALL not accept requests for notification FHIR versions it cannot support (servers MAY reject or coerce, according to their policies).\\n6) The content-type of the POST SHALL match the MIME type on the Subscription (Subscription.channel.payload).\\n7) In addition to the Subscription Status information, each notification MAY include additional resources or references to resources (URLs or ids).\\n\\n\\nFor each requirement identified, format as:\\n```\\nRequirement Text: \"<exact quote with [clarifications] and ... elisions>\"\\nConformance: <SHALL | SHOULD | MAY | SHALL NOT | SHOULD NOT>\\nActor: <specific actor name(s)>\\nConditional: <True/False>\\nSub-Requirements: <comma-separated list of referenced requirements or NONE>\\nSource: <specific section/location reference>\\n```\\n\\nContent to analyze:\\n[Hospital](Organization-Hospital.html \"Organization/Hospital\")   Hartford General Hospital\\n[JoeSmith](Practitioner-JoeSmith.html \"Practitioner/JoeSmith\")   Practitioner Dr Joe Smith\\n[JoeSmithRole1](PractitionerRole-JoeSmithRole1.html \"PractitionerRole/JoeSmithRole1\")   Dr Smith moonlighting as ER Doc at Hartford Hospital\\n[JoeSmithRole2](PractitionerRole-JoeSmithRole2.html \"PractitionerRole/JoeSmithRole2\")   Dr Smith Internal Medicine at Burr Clinic\\n[JoeSmithRole3](PractitionerRole-JoeSmithRole3.html \"PractitionerRole/JoeSmithRole3\")   Dr Smith Admitting Privileges at Hartford General\\n[PharmChain](Organization-PharmChain.html \"Organization/PharmChain\")   Organization that Provides Pharmacy Services\\n[PharmChainAffil1](OrganizationAffiliation-PharmChainAffil1.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/PharmChainAffil1\")   Organization Affiliation for PharmChain (Retail)\\n[PharmChainAffil2](OrganizationAffiliation-PharmChainAffil2.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/PharmChainAffil2\")   Organization Affiliation for PharmChain (Compounding)\\n[PharmChainAffil3](OrganizationAffiliation-PharmChainAffil3.html \"OrganizationAffiliation/PharmChainAffil3\")   Organization Affiliation for PharmChain (MailOrder)\\n[PharmChainCompService](HealthcareService-PharmChainCompService.html \"HealthcareService/PharmChainCompService\")   Compound Pharmacy Service provided by PharmacyOrganization A\\n[PharmChainMailService](HealthcareService-PharmChainMailService.html \"HealthcareService/PharmChainMailService\")   Mail Order Pharmacy Service provided by PharmacyOrganization A\\n[PharmChainRetailService](HealthcareService-PharmChainRetailService.html \"HealthcareService/PharmChainRetailService\")   Pharmacy Service provided by PharmChain\\n[PharmLoc1](Location-PharmLoc1.html \"Location/PharmLoc1\")   Location of Pharmacy1 in PharmChain’s network\\n[PharmLoc2](Location-PharmLoc2.html \"Location/PharmLoc2\")   Location of Pharmacy2 in PharmChain’s network\\n[PharmLoc3](Location-PharmLoc3.html \"Location/PharmLoc3\")   Location of Pharmacy3 in PharmChain’s network\\n[PharmLoc4](Location-PharmLoc4.html \"Location/PharmLoc4\")   Location of Pharmacy4 in PharmChain’s network\\n[StateOfCTLocation](Location-StateOfCTLocation.html \"Location/StateOfCTLocation\")   State of CT Area\\n[VirtualCounselService](HealthcareService-VirtualCounselService.html \"HealthcareService/VirtualCounselService\")   Virtual Counseling Service'}], 'model': 'gpt-4', 'max_tokens': 2048, 'temperature': 0.7}}\n",
