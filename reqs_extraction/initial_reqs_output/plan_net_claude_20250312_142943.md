Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 contains information about the change history and profiles defined in the guide. While it provides valuable context, it does not contain explicit, testable requirements. The content is primarily descriptive, outlining changes made since the previous version and defining various FHIR profiles used in the implementation guide.

After careful analysis, I have not identified any specific, testable requirements in this chunk that can be formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The information provided is mostly informative and does not include statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED that would typically indicate normative requirements.

If you need requirements extracted from other sections of the implementation guide that contain normative language, please provide those sections, and I'll be happy to analyze them and format the requirements accordingly.Introduction:
This chunk contains introductory information about the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0. While it provides valuable context and background information, it does not contain specific, testable requirements in the format we're looking for. The content is primarily descriptive, explaining the purpose, scope, and relationships of the implementation guide.

After careful analysis, I have not identified any specific, testable requirements in this chunk that meet the criteria for extraction and formatting according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The text primarily consists of background information, explanations of relationships between resources, and context-setting for the implementation guide.

If there were requirements to be extracted, they would be formatted as described in the instructions. However, this particular section does not contain such requirements. The actual requirements are likely to be found in more detailed sections of the implementation guide that describe specific behaviors, constraints, or expectations for implementers.Introduction:
This chunk from the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 appears to be an introductory section for the Examples page. It does not contain any explicit requirements using the specified keywords (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED). Instead, it provides context about the version and basis of the implementation guide.

No specific, testable requirements in INCOSE format can be extracted from this chunk. The content is primarily informational and does not prescribe any actions or constraints for implementers.

If you would like me to analyze additional sections of the implementation guide that may contain requirements, please provide those chunks, and I'll be happy to extract and format the requirements according to the INCOSE standards.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 contains an Examples Table that lists various FHIR resources and their corresponding profiles. While this table provides valuable information about the structure and content of the implementation guide, it does not contain explicit, testable requirements in the form of SHALL, SHOULD, or MAY statements.

After careful analysis, I have not identified any specific, testable requirements that can be formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards from this particular chunk of the implementation guide. The table presents examples of resources and their profiles but does not define any conformance criteria or actionable requirements for implementers.

If there are requirements related to the use or implementation of these example resources and profiles, they would likely be found in other sections of the implementation guide that provide more detailed specifications and conformance statements.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 primarily contains example resources and their references to profile definitions. While these examples are valuable for illustrating the implementation of the guide, they do not contain explicit, testable requirements in the format we're looking for (using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.).

After careful analysis, I have not found any specific, testable requirements in this chunk that can be formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards as requested. The content primarily consists of links to example resources and their corresponding FHIR resource types and profiles.

These examples serve as reference implementations and may implicitly suggest how the various resources should be structured and related. However, they do not provide explicit, normative statements that can be directly translated into formal requirements.

If requirements are needed based on these examples, they would need to be derived from a more comprehensive analysis of the entire Implementation Guide, including the profile definitions and any normative text describing the expected behavior and structure of these resources.## REQ-SERVER-SHALL-01

These requirements cover the key testable aspects of the Implementation section, focusing on privacy considerations and must-support interpretations for various actors in the Plan-Net ecosystem.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 primarily focuses on describing the relationships between various FHIR resources such as Insurance Plans, Networks, Practitioners, Organizations, Locations, and Endpoints. It provides examples and scenarios to illustrate these relationships but does not contain explicit, testable requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, or MUST statements. Therefore, no formal INCOSE-style requirements can be extracted from this content.

While this section is crucial for understanding the structure and relationships within the Plan Net Implementation Guide, it does not prescribe specific implementable requirements. Instead, it serves as a guide for how these resources should be used together to represent healthcare provider networks, insurance plans, and related entities.

If requirements are needed based on this information, they would need to be derived from the implied relationships and structures described, rather than extracted directly from the text. Any such derived requirements would need to be carefully reviewed and validated by domain experts to ensure they accurately reflect the intent of the Implementation Guide.## REQ-SERVER-SHALL-01

**Verification**: Test
**Notes**: Actor: Client, Conformance: SHALL (implied), Conditional: False
**Source**: Artifacts Summary, Behavior: Capability Statements section

These requirements are derived from the description of the Plan-Net CapabilityStatement. While not explicitly using SHALL or SHOULD, they imply expected behavior for servers and clients implementing this guide. The server requirement uses "should" in the original text, while the client requirement is implied as a necessary action for clients to function within this ecosystem.

No other explicit requirements were found in this chunk of the implementation guide. The remainder of the content provides an overview of the guide's structure and the types of artifacts it contains.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 focuses on Search Parameters, which define the properties by which a RESTful server can be searched. These search parameters are crucial for selecting specific resources based on various criteria. However, this section primarily lists the available search parameters without providing explicit requirements using conformance keywords such as SHALL, SHOULD, or MAY.

After careful analysis, I have not identified any explicit, testable requirements in this chunk that conform to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards as specified in the guidelines. The content provides a list of search parameters and their descriptions but does not dictate specific behaviors or obligations using conformance language.

While these search parameters are important for implementing search functionality in a FHIR-compliant system, the lack of explicit requirement statements means we cannot extract INCOSE-style requirements from this particular chunk.

If requirements related to these search parameters exist, they would likely be found in other sections of the implementation guide that describe how these parameters should be implemented or supported by servers and clients.## REQ-SERVER-SHALL-01

**Summary**: Support specified search parameters for resources
**Description**: "Servers implementing the Plan Net Implementation Guide SHALL support the search parameters defined for each resource type, including but not limited to: Location (address, endpoint, organization, partof, type), Organization (address, coverage-area, endpoint, name, partof, type), OrganizationAffiliation (endpoint, location, network, participating-organization, period, primary-organization, role, service, specialty), Practitioner (family-name, given-name, name), and PractitionerRole (endpoint, location, network, organization, period, practitioner, role, service, specialty)."
**Verification**: Test
**Notes**: Actor: Server, Conformance: SHALL, Conditional: False
**Source**: Search Parameters section of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0
```

This requirement is inferred from the context and common practices in FHIR implementation guides. It assumes that the listed search parameters are intended to be supported by conformant servers. However, it's important to note that without explicit normative language in the original text, this requirement should be verified against the full implementation guide to ensure it accurately reflects the guide's intentions.

No other explicit, testable requirements following the INCOSE format can be extracted from this specific chunk of the implementation guide. The content primarily serves as a reference for available search parameters rather than stating specific conformance requirements.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 primarily focuses on describing the structure definitions for various resources and extensions used in the implementation guide. While it provides valuable information about the resources and extensions, it does not contain explicit, testable requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, or similar language.

After careful analysis, I have not found any specific, testable requirements in this chunk that can be formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The content mainly consists of descriptive information about resource profiles and extension definitions without stating explicit conformance requirements.

If requirements are needed for these resources and extensions, they would likely be found in other sections of the implementation guide that describe the constraints, cardinalities, and usage rules for these elements. Those sections would be more appropriate for extracting INCOSE-style requirements.## REQ-IMPLEMENTER-SHALL-01

```

These requirements reflect the implicit expectations set by the terminology definitions in this chunk of the Implementation Guide. They establish the mandatory use of specific Value Sets and Code Systems for various aspects of healthcare service representation in conforming systems.Introduction:
This chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 contains a list of example instances that demonstrate the potential data structure and content for systems conforming to this implementation guide. While these examples are valuable for understanding the practical application of the guide, they do not contain explicit, testable requirements in the traditional sense.

After careful analysis, I have not identified any specific, testable requirements in this chunk that can be formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The content primarily consists of a list of example resources without prescriptive language or conformance statements.

These examples serve as reference implementations and can be useful for developers and implementers to understand how to structure and populate various FHIR resources in the context of the Plan Net Implementation Guide. However, they do not constitute formal requirements that can be directly inserted into a Software Requirements Specification.

If you need requirements related to the use or implementation of these example instances, it would be necessary to refer to other sections of the implementation guide that may contain normative statements about how these resources should be used or implemented in conformant systems.
