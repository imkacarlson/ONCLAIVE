##  Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 Requirements Extraction - Chunk 1/1 

**Introduction:** This document presents the requirements extracted from the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, specifically from the "ChangeHistory.md" and "profiles.md" files.  These files primarily document changes between versions and provide an overview of the profiles used in the implementation guide. No explicitly stated requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, or similar language were found in this chunk. 

**Therefore, no requirements have been extracted for this section.** 
##  INCOSE-style Requirements Extraction: DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0 (Chunk 1 of 2)

**Introduction**

This document presents a requirements extraction from the first chunk of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0, formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The extraction focuses on testable statements containing keywords like SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., which indicate requirements or recommendations for systems implementing the specification. 

**Requirements**

It is important to note that this section of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide focuses heavily on introductory information, context setting, and high-level descriptions. It does not contain explicitly stated requirements using the keywords we are looking for. Therefore, no testable requirements can be extracted in the INCOSE format from this specific chunk of the document. 

**Next Steps**

To extract further requirements, we will proceed with analyzing the next chunk of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide. We anticipate finding more concrete requirements in sections detailing specific data elements, operations, and interactions within the specification. 
## Introduction

This section analyzes the "Credits" and "Authors" sections of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 for extractable requirements. 

## Analysis Result

No testable requirements were found in this chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. This section primarily provides acknowledgment to contributors and lists the authors, lacking any SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED statements, or similar directives that would constitute testable requirements. 
## Introduction

This analysis covers "Examples," a subsection within the Da Vinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0.  This section does not contain normative language like "SHALL," "SHOULD," "MAY," etc. Therefore, no testable requirements can be extracted from this section. 
## Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 Requirement Extraction - Chunk 2 of 3

This section analyzes the "Examples Table" from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. This table provides a list of example resources with their corresponding ResourceTypes and required profiles. 

**Important Note:** This section of the implementation guide does not contain explicit requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, or similar language. It presents example data and expected profiles for those examples. Therefore, no testable requirements can be extracted in this chunk. 

While this section doesn't contain testable requirements, it provides valuable information for:

* **Developers:** Understanding the expected structure and profiles for different resources within the Plan Net context.
* **Testers:** Creating valid test data conforming to the Plan Net implementation guide. 

To ensure proper implementation, it's crucial to use this example table in conjunction with other sections of the implementation guide containing explicit requirements and guidance. 
## PlanNet Implementation Guide v1.2.0: Example Content Requirements Extraction (Chunk 3 of 3)

This document extracts testable requirements from chunk 3 of 3 of the PlanNet Implementation Guide v1.2.0, formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. This chunk focuses on example content, providing concrete instances of various FHIR resources like Location, Organization, Practitioner, and their associated profiles as defined by the PlanNet Implementation Guide. 

**Important:** This chunk primarily showcases example data and does not contain explicit requirements (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.) for implementers to follow. Therefore, no formal requirements are extracted in this section. 

While the examples illustrate how to populate resources conforming to PlanNet profiles, they don't impose specific obligations on implementers. These examples serve as valuable guidance for understanding and using the defined profiles but do not translate into testable requirements.

**Note:** This analysis extracted the core requirement from each search parameter description, focusing on the "Select [Resource] with/by..." phrasing. Further requirements regarding specific search parameter behavior (e.g., matching criteria, modifiers) might be present in the detailed descriptions within each linked HTML page.  A comprehensive analysis should delve into those individual pages to extract all relevant requirements. 
## Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 Requirements Extraction - Structures: Resource Profiles

This section analyzes the "Structures: Resource Profiles" section of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, specifically focusing on the definition of constraints on FHIR resources. It aims to extract testable requirements according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. 

However, this section primarily provides descriptions and guidance on how specific FHIR resources are profiled for the Plan Net implementation. It does not contain explicit SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED statements that translate into testable requirements. 

Therefore, no formal INCOSE-style requirements are extracted from this section. 
## Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 Requirements Extraction - Chunk 5/7

This section focuses on extracting requirements from the "Structures: Extension Definitions" section of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. This section defines specific constraints on FHIR data types for systems conforming to this implementation guide. 

**It is important to note that this section does not contain explicit requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Therefore, no testable requirements can be extracted using the provided guidelines.** 

This section primarily provides information about the defined extensions and their purpose. While these extensions impose constraints on data types, they are presented as informative rather than normative statements. 

To ensure comprehensive requirement coverage, it is recommended to review other sections of the Plan Net Implementation Guide for explicit requirements and constraints. 
## Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0: Terminology Requirements Extraction 

This section analyzes the "Terminology" section of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, specifically focusing on Value Sets and Code Systems. It aims to extract testable requirements according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.

**Important Note:** This section of the implementation guide primarily defines and describes various Value Sets and Code Systems. It does not contain explicit statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, or similar keywords that typically form testable requirements. 

Therefore, no explicit, testable requirements can be extracted from this section using the provided INCOSE format. 

While the Value Sets and Code Systems provide essential information for interoperability, they act as data models and definitions rather than actionable requirements.  Testing these would involve validating that systems use the defined codes and value sets correctly, which is implicit in the guide's overall purpose. 
## Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 - Chunk 7 of 7 Analysis

This section of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provides example instances of various FHIR resources. It does not contain normative statements with "SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED," or similar terms that would translate into testable requirements. 

Therefore, **no requirements are extracted from this chunk**.
