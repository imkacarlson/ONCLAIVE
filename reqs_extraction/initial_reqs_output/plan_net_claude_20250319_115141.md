# Requirements Analysis for Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 (Chunk 1 of 1)

After analyzing the provided content from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, I find that this particular chunk does not contain explicit requirements statements with SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or other conformance language. 

The provided content consists of:
1. A change history document detailing updates since v1.0.0
2. A profiles overview listing the profiles defined in the implementation guide

Neither of these sections contains actionable requirements that need to be extracted. The content is informational in nature, describing resources and changes rather than specifying conformance requirements.

No requirements have been identified in this particular chunk that would need to be formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.

If additional sections of the implementation guide were provided, particularly those containing conformance statements, requirements could be extracted from those sections.# PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide Requirements Analysis

I've analyzed the provided content from the PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. This introductory section primarily describes the scope, background, and relationships between resources in a payer's provider network directory, but does not contain explicit normative requirements using terms like SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.

The content focuses on:
- Introduction to the PDEX Payer Network Implementation Guide
- Relation to US Core and other Implementation Guides
- Background on provider directories and their use cases
- Overview of resource relationships in payer directories
- Credits and authorship information

While this content is important for understanding the context of the implementation guide, it does not contain specific testable requirements in the form of conformance statements that would be formatted according to INCOSE standards.

**Finding: No explicit requirements were found in this introductory chunk that meet the criteria for INCOSE-style requirement extraction.**

This is typical of introductory sections, which generally provide context rather than specific implementation requirements. Requirements would likely be found in subsequent sections that detail specific conformance criteria, profiles, and implementation guidelines.# Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 Requirements Analysis - Chunk 1

After analyzing the provided content from the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, I can report that this particular chunk (focused on the "Examples" section) does not contain any explicit requirements using normative language such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED.

The provided content merely includes a header indicating it's part of the Examples section of the Plan Net Implementation Guide, and provides basic version information stating that it's v1.1.0 STU 1 based on FHIR R4.

No specific technical requirements, conformance statements, or implementable directives are present in this chunk that would need to be formatted according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.

I will continue with the analysis of subsequent chunks to identify and format any requirements that may be present in other sections of the Implementation Guide.# Requirements Analysis for PlanNet Implementation Guide v1.2.0 (Chunk 2 of 3)

## Analysis Summary

After analyzing the provided content from chunk 2 of the PlanNet Implementation Guide v1.2.0, I have reviewed the Examples Table section. This section contains a list of example resources that demonstrate implementation of the various profiles defined in the guide.

## Requirements Findings

The provided content is a reference table showing example resources for different resource types and their corresponding profiles. This table is informational in nature and does not contain any normative language that establishes requirements (no SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, or MUST statements).

The table shows examples of:
- Endpoint resources
- HealthcareService resources
- InsurancePlan resources
- Location resources

Each example is linked to its corresponding FHIR resource type and the PlanNet profile it implements.

## Conclusion

**No explicit requirements were identified in this chunk of the implementation guide.**

The content represents a reference table of examples that implementers can use as guidance, but does not itself contain normative statements that would translate into testable requirements according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.# INCOSE-Style Requirements Extraction for Plan Net IG v1.2.0 - Chunk 3

## Introduction
This document presents the requirements extracted from chunk 3 of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. This chunk appears to contain references to example resources rather than normative content with explicit conformance requirements. After thorough analysis, I have not identified explicit SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, or other conformance statements in this section.

## Analysis Results

Upon careful examination of the provided content in chunk 3, which consists of a list of example resources with their corresponding resource types and profiles, I cannot identify any explicit conformance requirements. This section appears to be a reference table of example resources included in the implementation guide.

Each line in the provided content follows this pattern:
```
[ExampleID](Example-ExampleID.html)   [ResourceType](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resourcetype.html)   [ProfileName](StructureDefinition-profile-name.html)
```

These examples likely demonstrate the implementation of requirements defined elsewhere in the guide, but the example list itself does not contain normative requirements statements.

## Conclusion

No explicit requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED or similar conformance language were identified in this chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide. Requirements for these resource types and profiles would typically be defined in the corresponding profile definitions or in the normative text sections of the implementation guide, not in the example listing itself.## REQ-01

After analyzing the provided content from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, I found that this chunk primarily describes example scenarios and resources (Insurance Plans, Networks, Locations, Practitioners, PractitionerRoles, Organizations, OrganizationAffiliations, and Endpoints) with explanations of how they relate to each other. 

The content describes the structure and relationships between different FHIR resources in the Plan Net Implementation Guide, but does not contain explicit normative requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or similar terms. This section appears to be primarily informative rather than normative.

**No formal requirements were identified in this chunk.**

The content instead provides explanatory information about:
- How Insurance Plans are associated with Networks
- How Practitioners and Organizations indicate network participation
- How Locations are used to provide service information
- How Practitioners and PractitionerRoles relate to each other
- How Organizations and OrganizationAffiliations work
- How Endpoints provide technical details for electronic services

Each section includes references to example instances that demonstrate the concepts, but no specific conformance requirements are stated.## REQ-1

Note: This chunk primarily contains introductory content that describes the organization of the Implementation Guide rather than specific technical requirements. The requirements identified are relatively high-level and would likely be supplemented by more detailed specifications in later sections of the guide.# Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 - Requirements Analysis for Search Parameters

This analysis focuses on chunk 2 of 6 from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, which covers Search Parameters. The content in this chunk lists various search parameters for Endpoints, HealthcareServices, InsurancePlans, and Locations, but does not contain explicit requirements using conformance language (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, etc.).

While the section defines search parameters that a RESTful server can implement, it doesn't use conformance language to mandate their implementation. These search parameters represent capabilities rather than explicit requirements in this particular chunk.

**Note**: No explicit requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or other conformance language were identified in this chunk. The search parameters listed would typically be associated with requirements in other sections of the Implementation Guide that specify how and when these parameters must be supported.

If search parameter implementation requirements exist, they would likely be found in other sections of the Implementation Guide that discuss API conformance, server capabilities, or specific profiles.# Analysis of Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 Search Parameters

After reviewing chunk 3 of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, I observe this section contains a listing of search parameters for various FHIR resources in the Plan Net Implementation Guide. While these search parameters are important technical components of the implementation guide, this particular chunk does not contain explicit requirement statements using normative language such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED.

The content presented appears to be a navigation listing of available search parameters with their links and brief descriptions, rather than normative requirements statements. Each line represents a search parameter with its link and a brief description of its purpose, but doesn't specify conformance requirements.

Based on the guidelines provided, I cannot extract INCOSE-formatted requirements from this chunk as it does not contain explicit requirement statements with conformance verbs. To properly extract requirements related to these search parameters, I would need content that describes the conformance expectations for supporting or implementing these search parameters.

If you would like me to proceed with analyzing the next chunk or if you have additional context about how these search parameters should be treated as requirements, please advise.# INCOSE-Style Requirements Extraction - Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 (Chunk 4)

## Introduction

This analysis examines chunk 4 of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, which focuses on resource profiles and extension definitions. After careful review, I have not identified explicit requirements statements containing SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or other requirement language in this chunk. 

This portion of the documentation appears to be a structured index or catalog of the various profiles and extensions defined in the implementation guide, providing brief descriptive summaries rather than normative requirements. Each entry includes a title and description of its purpose but does not specify conformance requirements.

## Findings

The analyzed content consists of:
1. A listing of Plan-Net resource profiles (Endpoint, HealthcareService, InsurancePlan, Location, Network, Organization, OrganizationAffiliation, Practitioner, and PractitionerRole)
2. A listing of extension definitions (Accessibility, Communication Proficiency, Contactpoint Availabletime, Delivery Method, Endpoint Usecase, Location Reference, Network Reference, New Patients, Org Description, Practitioner Qualification, Qualification, and Via Intermediary)

Each listing provides a hyperlink to the detailed definition and a brief description of the resource or extension's purpose, but does not contain normative language establishing requirements.

To locate actual requirements, further analysis would need to examine the linked detailed definitions of each profile and extension, which would likely contain the SHALL, SHOULD, and MAY statements that establish conformance requirements.# Requirements Analysis for PlanNet Implementation Guide v1.2.0 - Chunk 5 of 6

## Introduction

This analysis covers chunk 5 of 6 from the PlanNet Implementation Guide v1.2.0, focusing on the Terminology section which defines Value Sets and Code Systems. This section primarily defines terminological artifacts rather than stating explicit requirements. However, the mere presence of these value sets and code systems indicates an implicit requirement for implementers to use these specific terminological resources.

After careful analysis of this chunk, I did not identify any explicit requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or other requirement-defining terminology. This chunk is primarily a reference listing of value sets and code systems that are defined in the implementation guide.

While these terminological resources are essential components of the implementation guide, they are presented as definitional artifacts rather than as explicit requirements. The specific requirements for using these value sets and code systems would likely be found in the sections describing the profiles and operations that use them.

## Conclusion

No explicit requirements were found in this chunk of the PlanNet Implementation Guide. The content consists of reference listings of value sets and code systems that support the implementation guide but does not contain specific conformance statements or testable requirements in the format required.

Implementers should reference other sections of the implementation guide to determine the specific contexts and requirements for using these terminological resources.# INCOSE-Style Requirements Analysis for Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 (Chunk 6 of 6)

## Analysis Summary

After thorough examination of chunk 6 of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, I have determined that this section contains only example instances that show what data produced and consumed by systems conforming with this implementation guide might look like. This section is titled "Example: Example Instances" and consists of a list of example FHIR resources with their descriptions.

## Findings

This chunk does not contain any normative statements using modal verbs like SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED that would indicate testable requirements. The content is purely informative, providing sample implementations to guide developers rather than specifying conformance requirements.

The examples listed include various FHIR resources such as:
- Organization resources (e.g., Acme, Hospital, PharmChain)
- Endpoint resources (e.g., AcmeOfCTPortalEndpoint)
- InsurancePlan resources (e.g., AcmeQHPBronze, AcmeQHPGold)
- PractitionerRole resources (e.g., AnonRole, JoeSmithRole1)
- Location resources (e.g., CancerClinicLoc, HospLoc1)
- HealthcareService resources (e.g., BurrClinicServices, HospERService)
- OrganizationAffiliation resources (e.g., BurrClinicAffil, ConnHIEAffil)
- Practitioner resources (e.g., Counselor, HansSolo)

## Conclusion

No testable requirements have been identified in this section of the implementation guide. This section serves as a reference library of example resources that conform to the implementation guide but does not itself impose any additional conformance requirements.
