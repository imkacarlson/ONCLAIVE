Introduction:
This chunk primarily deals with the change history of the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0. It lists a number of modifications that have been made since v1.0.0. These changes include updates to names, codes, optionalities, bindings, additions, management abilities, diagrams, spelling, and the directory structure. 

After a thorough review, it is clear that this particular content does not contain any specific, testable requirements that directly state what a system must, shall, should, or may do in terms of functionality. Instead, it lists updates that have been made to the guide itself. 

Consequently, no INCOSE-compliant requirements can be extracted from this chunk of the guide. Future chunks may contain specific requirements, which can then be analyzed and formatted according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.Based on the provided content from the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide, it's challenging to derive specific, testable requirements as it doesn't provide any explicit requirements or conformance directives. The content merely provides a general introduction to the Profiles section of the guide. 

It mentions the version of the guide, the FHIR version it's based on, and a link to other versions of the guide. However, these are not specific, testable requirements that could be formatted in the INCOSE style. 

It would be beneficial to analyze a portion of the guide where specific directives and requirements are given, such as the sections detailing the data models, API endpoints, or specific functionalities expected of the system.## REQ-ENDPOINT-SHALL-01

CONCLUSION:
The requirements extracted from this chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 focus on the services offered by an organization and the insurance plans offered by a payer.# Introduction
This analysis focuses on the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, specifically on details surrounding the PlannetLocation, PlannetNetwork, PlannetOrganization, PlannetOrganizationAffiliation, PlannetPractitioner, and PlannetPractitionerRole. Unfortunately, the provided content does not include explicit requirements in the form of SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST or REQUIRED statements. However, it does provide a foundation for understanding the context and functionality of each concept, which could be used to derive potential requirements in a full document review.

# Potential Requirements
Though this chunk does not provide explicit requirements, the descriptions suggest potential testable requirements that might be found in a complete analysis of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0. Examples might include:

- The system shall allow Locations to range in scope from a room in a building to a geographic region/area.
- The system shall represent individuals and organizations as participants in a Plan-Net Network through the practitionerRole and Plan-Net-organizationAffiliation resources.
- The system should be able to describe relationships between two or more organizations, including the services one organization provides another, the location(s) where they provide services, the availability of those services, electronic endpoints, and other relevant information.
- The system must allow a Practitioner to be a person who is directly or indirectly involved in the provisioning of healthcare.
- The system should describe the role a practitioner plays at an organization, including the services they provide, the location(s) where they work, and their availability, electronic endpoints, and other relevant information.

To convert these into INCOSE-style requirements, full statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. would need to be provided in the Implementation Guide.Introduction: This analysis covers chunk 1 of 5 from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, specifically focusing on the 'Home' section. The requirements extracted are based on the information given about the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net implementation guide. 

Given the content provided, no specific, testable requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED have been identified. This section primarily provides general information about the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net implementation guide and does not stipulate any particular actions or conditions that must be met. 

For future analysis, it is recommended to include sections of the FHIR Implementation Guide that provide specific directives or guidelines for implementation. These will typically include key phrases such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED to indicate the conformance level of the requirement. 

It is also worth noting that any requirements identified would need to be testable, meaning they should describe a specific functionality or behavior that can be objectively measured or verified. Requirements may also be conditional, meaning they only apply under certain circumstances or when optional features are in use. 

The INCOSE Systems Engineering standard would be applied to any such requirements identified, formatting them to include a summary, exact quote, recommended verification method, notes, and source reference.## REQ-SERVER-SHALL-01

# NOTE
This chunk of the Implementation Guide does not contain statements explicitly using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. The requirements identified are inferred from the context and might require further clarification in the next iterations of the Implementation Guide or during the requirements validation process.After analyzing chunk 5 of 5 from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, it appears that this section does not contain any specific, testable requirements. This section is primarily dedicated to listing the authors and their contact information. 

It doesn't include any statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., which typically indicate the presence of specific requirements. Moreover, it doesn't provide any functional, performance, or constraint requirements relevant to the system being described in the implementation guide.

Therefore, no INCOSE-style requirements can be extracted from this section of the guide.Introduction: The content provided is from the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.1.0 based on FHIR R4. This content does not offer explicit, testable requirements. It provides general information about the guide being based on FHIR R4 and being the currently published version. It also provides a link to the Directory of published versions. It does not include specific SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED directives that can be translated into INCOSE-style requirements.

Therefore, no specific, testable requirements can be extracted from this chunk of the Implementation Guide. However, it is important to note that the overall guide is expected to conform to FHIR R4 standards as stated in the provided information. Future chunks may provide more detailed requirements for further analysis.## REQ-SERVER-SHALL-01

(Note: The content provided did not include direct quotations with SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Therefore, the descriptions are based on logical interpretation and may require adjustment based on full context.)Based on the provided context, the task is to analyze the Plan Net Implementation Guide content related to various locations and organizations. However, there are no explicit requirements, statements, or directives using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. in the given content.

Therefore, no INCOSE-style requirements can be extracted from this particular content. Further analysis would be required on other parts of the Implementation Guide or additional context may be necessary to generate INCOSE-style requirements.Introduction:
The provided content appears to list a series of organizations and associated FHIR resources. There are no explicit statements using terms such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., hence no specific, testable requirements can be extracted from this content according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. 

However, it could be inferred that these organizations must be able to support the associated FHIR resources, but without more context or explicit statements, it's not possible to create specific, testable requirements in INCOSE-compliant format. 

If additional information or context was provided, it might be possible to generate requirements. For example, if there was a statement such as "Each listed organization SHALL support the associated FHIR resource," a requirement could be generated. In the absence of such explicit statements, no requirements can be extracted from this content. 

Please provide additional information or a different chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 for further analysis.The content provided does not contain any specific, testable requirements for a FHIR Implementation Guide. The elements listed appear to be referencing different resources or components within a FHIR implementation, such as Organizations or Organization Affiliations. However, there are no statements specifying how these elements should be used or implemented, nor is there any use of language such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED, which would indicate a specific requirement or constraint. 

Therefore, based on the provided content, it is not possible to generate INCOSE-style requirements. Further analysis may be needed on the full FHIR Implementation Guide or additional sections of the guide.Introduction:
The provided content appears to be a list of links related to different practitioners, practitioner roles, and organization affiliations within a healthcare setting. The links reference different pages within the FHIR Implementation Guide, specifically those that detail the structure definitions for different elements of the FHIR data model such as the 'OrganizationAffiliation' and 'PractitionerRole'. 

However, without the context provided by the full content of these linked pages, it's not possible to extract specific, testable requirements from this list. The links themselves don't contain any statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., which could be interpreted as requirements. 

For a complete and accurate requirements extraction, the full content of the referenced pages would need to be analyzed. As such, there are no requirements that can be extracted from this particular chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide.## REQ-SERVER-SHALL-01

# INTRODUCTION
In this section of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0, the focus is on Practitioners and PractitionerRoles. It details how Practitioner instances provide specific information about a person and how PractitionerRole defines a practitioner's role. It then provides several scenarios and example instances for different roles. 

# REQUIREMENTS EXTRACTION
After a comprehensive analysis of the provided chunk, no specific testable requirements are identified that follow the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. The information provided in this section is more explanatory and descriptive of the specific instances of Practitioners and PractitionerRoles rather than dictating any necessary requirements or actions.

# SUMMARY
In summary, this section of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 does not contain any specific, testable requirements as per INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. Thus, there are no requirements to format or analyze further in this context.Introduction:
The given chunk highlights two key areas related to the FHIR Implementation Guide - Organizations and Organization Affiliations, and Endpoints. The first section focuses on the association of specific services with organizations and their hierarchies, while the second section provides details on the technical aspects of electronic service endpoints. However, upon careful review, the provided text does not specify any concrete, testable requirements using verbiage such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. 

Therefore, based on the provided content, no specific, testable requirements in INCOSE-compliant format can be extracted. The content provided is mostly descriptive and doesn't provide any explicit directives or conformance levels that would be required for INCOSE-style requirements extraction.## REQ-SERVER-SHOULD-01

Note: The content provided for analysis does not contain any statements using SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. The extracted requirements are based on the implicit requirement and conformance level from the provided content. These requirements were extracted assuming that "SHALL" is the conformance level for the statements in the content.# INTRODUCTION
This analysis involves the extraction of specific, testable requirements from the Plan-Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 chunk 9 of 20. This section primarily focuses on the descriptions of Plan-Net HealthcareService and InsurancePlan resources. Although these descriptions provide valuable context, they do not contain explicit conformance language (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc.). Therefore, no specific, testable requirements can be extracted from this chunk in an INCOSE-compliant format.

# REQUIREMENTS

No specific, testable requirements identified in this chunk.

# CONCLUSION
While the descriptions of Plan-Net HealthcareService and InsurancePlan resources provide important context, they do not contain explicit conformance language, and hence, specific, testable requirements cannot be extracted from this chunk. Future chunks may provide more explicit conformance language, from which specific, testable requirements can be extracted.Based on the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, there are no explicit requirements given that use the conformance terms such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. The content provided is descriptive information about different elements like Plan-Net Location, Plan-Net Network, Plan-Net Organization, Plan-Net OrganizationAffiliation, Plan-Net Practitioner, Plan-Net PractitionerRole, but no explicit, testable requirements are provided. 

Therefore, it is not possible to generate INCOSE-style requirements based on this information. Further information or a more detailed part of the Implementation Guide is needed to extract specific, testable requirements.## REQ-SYSTEM-SHALL-01

It should be noted that all the requirements identified from this chunk are related to implementation of Value Sets by the system, which is a crucial aspect of ensuring interoperability and standardization in healthcare data exchange.Introduction:
The chunk of the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 provided for analysis contains references to multiple ValueSets that are used within the FHIR framework for Healthcare Services. These include specifications for HealthcareService types, Individual and Group Specialties, Individual Specialties, Degrees, Licenses, and Certificates, Insurance Plan Types, Insurance Product Types, Language Proficiency, and Minimum Endpoint Connection Types. 

Based on the provided chunk, no specific, testable requirements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. have been identified. This chunk primarily provides reference information rather than implementation instructions or requirements. 

A full requirements analysis would require additional context, including surrounding sections of the implementation guide and the full content of the referenced ValueSets.Based on the provided FHIR Implementation Guide chunk, this task involves extracting and analyzing various value sets related to healthcare organizations, roles, and specialties. The value sets include Network Type, Non-Individual Specialties, Organization Type, PractitionerRole Code, Qualification Status, and more.

However, in the provided chunk, there are no explicit requirements using the keywords SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Therefore, it is not possible to extract specific, testable requirements from this chunk according to the INCOSE Systems Engineering standards.

The content provided is more about providing information and definitions of various value sets rather than stipulating requirements for a system or process. Each value set provides a list of possible values for a specific attribute within a FHIR resource but does not impose any specific conditions or requirements that would be applicable for a requirement extraction.

Therefore, this analysis concludes that there are no INCOSE-style requirements to be extracted from this chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide v1.2.0. The content is informational and defines various terminologies rather than providing specific, testable, and INCOSE-compliant requirements.## REQ-SYSTEM-IMPLIED-01

More similar requirements can be created for the remaining code systems mentioned in the content. While these requirements are implicit rather than explicit, they are nonetheless critical for a system to successfully conform to the Plan Net Implementation Guide. Each of these requirements would need to be tested to verify correct implementation.After thorough analysis, this particular chunk from the Plan Net Implementation Guide v1.2.0 does not appear to contain direct, explicit requirements that can be extracted and formatted in an INCOSE-compliant manner. 

The provided content mainly includes examples of instance data that could be produced or consumed by systems conforming to this implementation guide. It does not include direct statements using SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc., and does not specify actions or conditions that could be interpreted as requirements for a specific actor.

Therefore, no INCOSE-style requirements can be generated from this particular chunk of the Implementation Guide. Future chunks of the guide might contain explicit requirements and should be analyzed separately.Based on the provided FHIR Implementation Guide content, there do not appear to be any specific, testable requirements. The content provided mainly lists a series of clinical services, organizations, locations, and practitioner roles, but does not provide specific actions or behaviors that can be formatted as requirements.

For instance, there are no statements using key terms such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, or REQUIRED that would typically indicate a requirement. Further, there are no identifiable actors or specific actions associated with these entities that could form the basis for a requirement.

Therefore, in this instance, there are no INCOSE-style requirements that can be extracted from this specific chunk of the FHIR Implementation Guide content.Introduction: The provided FHIR Implementation Guide content seems to be a list of healthcare entities such as practitioners, locations, services, and affiliations. However, it does not contain specific statements of requirement using terms like SHALL, SHOULD, MUST, REQUIRED, etc. Therefore, it is not possible to extract INCOSE-compliant requirements from this particular content.

Nonetheless, this information could be used to construct potential scenarios or use cases for testing purposes. For example, verifying the ability of a system to correctly record and retrieve information about healthcare entities such as solo practitioners, their roles, locations, services, affiliations, etc. 

If the guide provided directives or rules about these entities (e.g., "Every Practitioner SHALL have at least one PractitionerRole"), it would then be possible to extract specific, testable requirements. However, given the content provided, no INCOSE-style requirements can be extracted.
