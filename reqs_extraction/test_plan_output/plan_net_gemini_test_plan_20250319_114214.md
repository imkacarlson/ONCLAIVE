2. **With Invalid Authentication:**
   - Send a GET request to the same endpoint with deliberately invalid authentication credentials (e.g., non-existent username/password).
   - **Expected Result:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) with the requested resource(s). No authentication challenge should be issued.

**Validation Criteria:**

* The server responds with HTTP status code 200 (OK) in both scenarios.
* The response content contains the requested resource(s).
* No authentication-related headers or challenges are present in the server response.

**Automation:**

```python
import requests

# Test without authentication
response = requests.get('http://<fhir-server-url>/Patient')
assert response.status_code == 200

# Test with invalid authentication
response = requests.get('http://<fhir-server-url>/Patient', auth=('invaliduser', 'invalidpassword'))
assert response.status_code == 200
```

## 5. Special Testing Considerations

**5.1 Edge Cases:**

* Test with various HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) to ensure consistent behavior.
* Attempt accessing resources with different levels of nesting (e.g., /Patient/123/Observation).

**5.2 Performance Considerations:**

* While not the primary focus, monitor response times to ensure the absence of authentication mechanisms doesn't introduce performance bottlenecks.
