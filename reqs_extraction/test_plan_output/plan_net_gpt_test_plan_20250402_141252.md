**Description**: "Health Plan API actors SHALL be capable of populating all Must Support data elements as part of the query results."

**Actor**: Health Plan API

**Conformance**: SHALL

```markdown
# Test Specification for REQ-05: Populate all Must Support data elements for Health Plan API query results

## 1. Requirement Analysis

### Testability Assessment
- **Classification**: Automatic
- **Rationale**: The requirement involves verifying the presence of specific data elements in API responses, which can be automated using test scripts.

### Complexity
- **Level**: Moderate
- **Rationale**: While the task of checking for Must Support elements is straightforward, the complexity arises from the need to handle various data types and ensure comprehensive coverage across different API responses.

### Prerequisites
- **System Configurations**: 
  - Health Plan API must be deployed and accessible.
  - API keys or authentication tokens configured for access.
- **Data Setup**: 
  - A dataset containing a variety of health plan records with known Must Support elements.
  - Access to FHIR server with sample data pre-loaded.

## 2. Test Implementation Strategy

### Required FHIR Operations
- **API Calls**:
  - `GET /HealthPlan`
  - `GET /HealthPlan/{id}`

### Test Data Requirements
- **Test Data**:
  - Health plan records with a complete set of Must Support elements.
  - Records with missing Must Support elements for negative testing.

### Validation Criteria
- **Checks**:
  - Verify that all Must Support elements are present in the API response.
  - Validate the correctness and format of each Must Support element.
  - Ensure no unexpected errors occur during the API call.

## 3. Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
function testMustSupportElementsInHealthPlanAPI():
    # Define Must Support elements
    mustSupportElements = ["element1", "element2", "element3"]

    # Positive Test Case: Valid Health Plan Record
    response = callAPI("GET", "/HealthPlan")
    assert response.statusCode == 200
    for record in response.data:
        for element in mustSupportElements:
            assert element in record
            assert validateElementFormat(record[element])

    # Negative Test Case: Missing Must Support Elements
    response = callAPI("GET", "/HealthPlan/{id_with_missing_elements}")
    assert response.statusCode == 200
    for element in mustSupportElements:
        if element not in response.data:
            logWarning(f"Missing Must Support element: {element}")

    # Edge Case: Empty Response
    response = callAPI("GET", "/HealthPlan/empty")
    assert response.statusCode == 200
    assert response.data == []

    # Error Handling
    try:
        response = callAPI("GET", "/HealthPlan/invalid")
    except APIError as e:
        assert e.statusCode == 404
        logError("Invalid Health Plan ID")

function validateElementFormat(element):
    # Implement specific validation logic for each element type
    return True
```

## 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

### Corner Cases
- **Empty API Response**: Ensure the system handles empty datasets gracefully.
- **Invalid Health Plan ID**: Test the API's response to invalid or non-existent IDs.
- **Partial Data**: Verify how the API handles records with incomplete data.

### Performance Considerations
- Test the API's response time and performance under load, especially when querying large datasets.

### Security Considerations
- Ensure that the API does not expose sensitive information inadvertently.
- Validate that authentication and authorization mechanisms are correctly enforced.

- **Rationale**: The requirement involves verifying the presence of specific data in a server's CapabilityStatement, which can be checked programmatically.

### Complexity
- **Classification**: Simple
- **Rationale**: The requirement involves straightforward retrieval and verification of data from a known FHIR resource.

### Prerequisites
- **System Configurations**: 
  - A FHIR server with a CapabilityStatement that includes the SubscriptionTopic Canonical extension.
- **Data Setup**: 
  - Ensure that the server has at least one SubscriptionTopic configured and advertised in the CapabilityStatement.

## 2. Test Implementation Strategy

### Required FHIR Operations
- **CapabilityStatement Retrieval**: Perform a `GET` operation on the server's CapabilityStatement endpoint.

### Test Data Requirements
- **Test Data**: 
  - No specific test data is needed beyond the existing configuration of the server's SubscriptionTopics.

### Validation Criteria
- **Checks**:
  - The CapabilityStatement must include the `SubscriptionTopic` Canonical extension.
  - The extension must list all supported canonical URLs for SubscriptionTopics.
  - Each listed URL must be a valid canonical URL format.

## 3. Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudo
function testAdvertiseSupportedCanonicalURLForSubscriptionTopic():
    try:
        // Step 1: Retrieve the CapabilityStatement from the FHIR server
        response = httpGet("https://fhir-server.example.com/metadata")
        
        // Step 2: Check if the response is successful
        if response.statusCode != 200:
            logError("Failed to retrieve CapabilityStatement. Status Code: " + response.statusCode)
            return "FAIL"
        
        // Step 3: Parse the CapabilityStatement
        capabilityStatement = parseJson(response.body)
        
        // Step 4: Check for the SubscriptionTopic Canonical extension
        if not capabilityStatement.contains("extension"):
            logError("CapabilityStatement does not contain any extensions.")
            return "FAIL"
        
        subscriptionTopicExtension = findExtension(capabilityStatement, "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/capabilitystatement-subscriptiontopic")
        
        if subscriptionTopicExtension is None:
            logError("SubscriptionTopic Canonical extension not found in CapabilityStatement.")
            return "FAIL"
        
        // Step 5: Validate the canonical URLs
        canonicalUrls = subscriptionTopicExtension["valueCanonical"]
        
        if not canonicalUrls:
            logError("No canonical URLs found in SubscriptionTopic extension.")
            return "FAIL"
        
        for url in canonicalUrls:
            if not isValidCanonicalUrl(url):
                logError("Invalid canonical URL found: " + url)
                return "FAIL"
        
        logInfo("All canonical URLs are valid.")
        return "PASS"
    
    except Exception as e:
        logError("An error occurred during testing: " + e.message)
        return "FAIL"

// Helper function to validate canonical URL format
function isValidCanonicalUrl(url):
    // Implement URL validation logic
    return url.startsWith("http://") or url.startsWith("https://")

// Helper function to find a specific extension
function findExtension(capabilityStatement, url):
    for extension in capabilityStatement["extension"]:
        if extension["url"] == url:
            return extension
    return None
```

## 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

### REQ-02: Plan Net Endpoint resources SHALL conform to the PlannetEndpoint profile.

**Description**: "Server SHALL ensure Plan Net Endpoint resources conform to the PlannetEndpoint profile."

**Actor**: Server

**Conformance**: SHALL

```markdown
# Test Specification for REQ-02: Plan Net Endpoint Conformance

## 1. Requirement Analysis

### Testability Assessment
- **Classification**: Automatic
- **Rationale**: The requirement specifies that the conformance to the PlannetEndpoint profile can be verified through automated testing tools that validate FHIR resource profiles.

### Complexity
- **Level**: Moderate
- **Rationale**: While the conformance check is straightforward, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all profile constraints requires a thorough understanding of the PlannetEndpoint profile.

### Prerequisites
- **System Configurations**: 
  - Access to the FHIR server with the capability to retrieve and validate Endpoint resources.
- **Data Setup**:
  - The server must have pre-existing Plan Net Endpoint resources that are intended to conform to the PlannetEndpoint profile.
  - Access to the PlannetEndpoint profile definition for validation purposes.

## 2. Test Implementation Strategy

### Required FHIR Operations
- **GET** `/Endpoint`: Retrieve existing Endpoint resources.
- **GET** `/metadata`: Retrieve server capability statement to ensure support for the PlannetEndpoint profile.

### Test Data Requirements
- A set of Endpoint resources that are expected to conform to the PlannetEndpoint profile.
- The PlannetEndpoint profile definition for validation.

### Validation Criteria
- Each Endpoint resource must:
  - Validate successfully against the PlannetEndpoint profile using a FHIR validation tool.
  - Include all mandatory elements as specified in the profile.
  - Adhere to any fixed values or constraints defined in the profile.

## 3. Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
function testPlannetEndpointConformance():
    # Step 1: Retrieve the PlannetEndpoint profile definition
    profileDefinition = fetchProfileDefinition("PlannetEndpoint")

    # Step 2: Retrieve all Endpoint resources from the server
    endpointResources = fetchResources("/Endpoint")

    # Step 3: Validate each Endpoint resource against the PlannetEndpoint profile
    for endpoint in endpointResources:
        validationResult = validateResourceAgainstProfile(endpoint, profileDefinition)

        # Positive Test Case: Resource conforms to the profile
        if validationResult.isValid:
            log("PASS: Endpoint resource " + endpoint.id + " conforms to PlannetEndpoint profile.")
        else:
            # Negative Test Case: Resource does not conform
            log("FAIL: Endpoint resource " + endpoint.id + " does not conform to PlannetEndpoint profile.")
            log("Errors: " + validationResult.errors)

        # Step 4: Check for mandatory elements and constraints
        checkMandatoryElements(endpoint, profileDefinition)
        checkConstraints(endpoint, profileDefinition)

function fetchProfileDefinition(profileName):
    # Simulate fetching the profile definition
    return apiCall("/StructureDefinition/" + profileName)

function fetchResources(resourceType):
    # Simulate fetching resources from the server
    return apiCall(resourceType)

function validateResourceAgainstProfile(resource, profileDefinition):
    # Simulate validation process
    return validationTool.validate(resource, profileDefinition)

function checkMandatoryElements(resource, profileDefinition):
    # Check for mandatory elements
    for element in profileDefinition.mandatoryElements:
        if not resource.hasElement(element):
            log("FAIL: Missing mandatory element " + element + " in resource " + resource.id)

function checkConstraints(resource, profileDefinition):
    # Check for constraints
    for constraint in profileDefinition.constraints:
        if not resource.meetsConstraint(constraint):
            log("FAIL: Resource " + resource.id + " fails constraint " + constraint.id)
```

## 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

- **Corner Cases**:
  - Test with Endpoint resources that have optional elements missing to ensure they still conform if mandatory elements are present.
  - Test with resources that have additional elements not defined in the profile to verify they do not affect conformance.

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Ensure the validation process is efficient and does not cause significant delays, especially with a large number of resources.

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Ensure that the validation process does not expose sensitive data and adheres to data protection regulations.

  - At least one Network resource without an NPI (for negative testing).

### Validation Criteria
- **Checks**:
  - Verify that each Network resource returned by the server includes a non-empty NPI field.
  - Ensure that the NPI conforms to the expected format (e.g., 10-digit numeric).

## 3. Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
function testNetworkNPICompliance():
    # Retrieve all Network resources
    response = FHIRServer.GET("/Network")
    assert response.status_code == 200, "Failed to retrieve Network resources"
    
    networks = response.json()
    
    # Positive Test Case: Networks with NPI
    for network in networks:
        npi = network.get('identifier', {}).get('value', None)
        assert npi is not None, f"Network {network['id']} is missing an NPI"
        assert isValidNPI(npi), f"Network {network['id']} has an invalid NPI format: {npi}"
    
    # Negative Test Case: Network without NPI
    # Assuming we have a known Network ID without NPI for testing
    response = FHIRServer.GET("/Network/knownNetworkWithoutNPI")
    assert response.status_code == 200, "Failed to retrieve specific Network resource"
    
    network = response.json()
    npi = network.get('identifier', {}).get('value', None)
    assert npi is None, f"Network {network['id']} unexpectedly has an NPI: {npi}"

function isValidNPI(npi):
    # Check if NPI is a 10-digit numeric string
    return npi.isdigit() and len(npi) == 10
```

## 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

### Corner Cases
- **Empty Network List**: Ensure the test handles cases where no Network resources are returned.
- **Multiple Identifiers**: Test scenarios where a Network resource has multiple identifiers and ensure the correct one is validated as the NPI.

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Dataset**: If the server contains a large number of Network resources, consider pagination or batch processing to avoid timeouts.

### Security Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that the test does not expose sensitive information and complies with data protection regulations.

  - `GET /Directory` - To perform a directory query without consumer identification.

### Test Data Requirements
- **Test Data**: 
  - No specific consumer data is required.
  - Ensure directory data is populated in the server for query testing.

### Validation Criteria
- **Checks**:
  - Verify that the server does not return an error related to missing consumer identification.
  - Confirm that the directory data is returned successfully without requiring any consumer-specific information.

## 3. Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
function testDirectoryQueryWithoutConsumerID():
    try:
        // Positive Test Case: Query directory without consumer ID
        response = sendGETRequest("/Directory")
        
        // Validate response
        if response.statusCode == 200:
            log("PASS: Directory query succeeded without consumer ID.")
        else:
            log("FAIL: Directory query failed. Status Code: " + response.statusCode)
        
        // Negative Test Case: Attempt to query with consumer ID (should not be allowed)
        responseWithID = sendGETRequest("/Directory", headers={"Consumer-ID": "12345"})
        
        // Validate response
        if responseWithID.statusCode == 400 or responseWithID.statusCode == 403:
            log("PASS: Server correctly rejected consumer ID in directory query.")
        else:
            log("FAIL: Server accepted consumer ID in directory query. Status Code: " + responseWithID.statusCode)
    
    except Exception as e:
        log("ERROR: Exception occurred during testing - " + str(e))

function sendGETRequest(endpoint, headers={}):
    // Simulate sending a GET request to the FHIR server
    // Return a mock response object with statusCode and body attributes
    return mockResponse

function log(message):
    // Output the message to the test log
    print(message)
```

## 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

### Corner Cases

### REQ-06: Provide lastUpdate timestamp in profile data content

**Description**: "Server SHALL provide the lastUpdate timestamp as part of each profile's data content."

**Actor**: Server

**Conformance**: SHALL

```markdown
# Test Specification for REQ-06: Provide lastUpdate Timestamp in Profile Data Content

## 1. Requirement Analysis

### Testability Assessment
- **Classification**: Automatic
- **Rationale**: The presence of the `lastUpdate` timestamp can be verified programmatically by inspecting the server's response data.

### Complexity
- **Level**: Simple
- **Rationale**: The requirement involves checking for a single field in the response data.

### Prerequisites
- **System Configurations**: Access to the FHIR server with appropriate permissions to retrieve profile data.
- **Data Setup**: Ensure that the server has profiles with known `lastUpdate` timestamps.

## 2. Test Implementation Strategy

### Required FHIR Operations

- **Format Check**: Ensure the `lastUpdate` timestamp is in a valid datetime format (e.g., ISO 8601).
- **Value Check**: Confirm the `lastUpdate` timestamp is reasonable (e.g., not a future date).

## 3. Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudo
function testLastUpdateTimestampPresence(profileId):
    // Positive Test Case
    response = GET /StructureDefinition/{profileId}
    assert response.statusCode == 200, "Expected HTTP 200 OK"

    // Check for lastUpdate field
    lastUpdate = response.data.lastUpdate
    assert lastUpdate is not None, "lastUpdate field is missing"

    // Validate lastUpdate format
    assert isValidISO8601(lastUpdate), "lastUpdate is not in valid ISO 8601 format"

    // Validate lastUpdate value
    assert isReasonableDate(lastUpdate), "lastUpdate is not a reasonable date"

function isValidISO8601(dateString):
    // Implement ISO 8601 date validation logic
    return true or false

function isReasonableDate(dateString):
    // Implement logic to check if date is not in the future
    return true or false

// Negative Test Case
function testInvalidProfileId():
    response = GET /StructureDefinition/invalidProfileId
    assert response.statusCode == 404, "Expected HTTP 404 Not Found"
```

## 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

### Corner Cases
- **Missing lastUpdate**: Profiles without a `lastUpdate` should be flagged.
- **Invalid Date Format**: Ensure the server does not return an incorrectly formatted date.
- **Future Dates**: `lastUpdate` should not be a future date; this might indicate a server clock issue.

### Performance Considerations
- **Load Testing**: Ensure the server can handle multiple requests for profile data without performance degradation.

### Security Considerations
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure `lastUpdate` timestamps are not tampered with during transmission.
- **Access Control**: Verify that unauthorized users cannot access profile data.

```
This test specification provides a structured approach to verifying the presence and correctness of the `lastUpdate` timestamp in FHIR profile data, ensuring compliance with the implementation guide requirement REQ-06.

### REQ-08: Return Status 404 for unknown resource

**Description**: "Server SHALL return Status 404 for unknown resources."

**Actor**: Server

**Conformance**: SHALL

# Test Specification for REQ-08: Return Status 404 for Unknown Resource

## 1. Requirement Analysis

### Testability Assessment
- **Classification**: Automatic
  - This requirement can be tested using automated scripts that simulate API requests and verify responses.

### Complexity
- **Complexity**: Simple
  - The requirement involves checking the HTTP status code for a straightforward scenario.

### Prerequisites
- **Required System Configurations**: 
  - A running instance of the FHIR server under test.
  - Network access to the FHIR server.
- **Data or Setup**:
  - Ensure the server is in a known state with no resources corresponding to the test IDs.

## 2. Test Implementation Strategy

### Required FHIR Operations
- **HTTP GET Operation**: Perform GET requests on known and unknown resource endpoints.

### Test Data Requirements
- **Known Resource ID**: A valid resource ID that exists on the server.
- **Unknown Resource ID**: A resource ID that does not exist on the server (e.g., a randomly generated UUID).

### Validation Criteria
- **Conformance Check**: 
  - The server returns HTTP status code 404 for requests to unknown resource IDs.
  - The server does not return 404 for known resource IDs.

## 3. Pseudocode Implementation

```plaintext
function testUnknownResourceReturns404():
    # Define known and unknown resource IDs
    knownResourceID = "12345"  # Replace with an actual known resource ID
    unknownResourceID = "non-existent-id-67890"  # Ensure this ID does not exist

    # Positive Test Case: Known Resource
    response = httpGet("http://fhir-server-url/ResourceType/" + knownResourceID)
    assert response.statusCode != 404, "Expected non-404 for known resource, got " + response.statusCode

    # Negative Test Case: Unknown Resource
    response = httpGet("http://fhir-server-url/ResourceType/" + unknownResourceID)
    assert response.statusCode == 404, "Expected 404 for unknown resource, got " + response.statusCode

    # Edge Case: Empty Resource ID
    response = httpGet("http://fhir-server-url/ResourceType/")
    assert response.statusCode == 404, "Expected 404 for empty resource ID, got " + response.statusCode

    # Edge Case: Malformed Resource ID
    malformedResourceID = "!@#$%^&*()"
    response = httpGet("http://fhir-server-url/ResourceType/" + malformedResourceID)
    assert response.statusCode == 404, "Expected 404 for malformed resource ID, got " + response.statusCode

function httpGet(url):
    # Simulate HTTP GET request
    # Return a response object with a statusCode attribute
    # This is a placeholder for actual HTTP request logic
    return simulatedHttpResponse(url)

function simulatedHttpResponse(url):
    # Simulate server response based on URL
    # This is a placeholder for actual server interaction
    if "non-existent-id" in url or url.endswith("/") or "!@#$%^&*()" in url:
        return Response(404)
    else:
        return Response(200)

class Response:
    def __init__(self, statusCode):
        self.statusCode = statusCode
```

## 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

### Corner Cases
- **Empty Resource ID**: Ensure the server returns 404 when the resource ID is missing.
- **Malformed Resource ID**: Test with invalid characters in the resource ID to ensure the server handles it gracefully.

### Performance or Security Considerations
- **Performance**: Ensure the server can handle multiple requests for unknown resources without degradation in performance.
- **Security**: Verify that the server does not expose sensitive information in error messages when returning a 404 status.

### Prerequisites
- **System Configurations**: 
  - A FHIR server instance that supports the Organization resource.
  - Access to the server's API with appropriate permissions.
- **Data Setup**:
  - Preloaded Organization resources with diverse address data to facilitate meaningful search results.

## 2. Test Implementation Strategy

### Required FHIR Operations
- **API Calls**:
  - `GET [base]/Organization?address=[address]`
  - `GET [base]/Organization?address-city=[city]`
  - `GET [base]/Organization?address-state=[state]`
  - `GET [base]/Organization?address-postalcode=[postalcode]`
  - `GET [base]/Organization?address-country=[country]`

### Test Data Requirements
- **Test Data**:
  - Organizations with varied address components:
    - Full addresses
    - Partial addresses (only city, state, etc.)
    - Addresses with special characters or different formats

### Validation Criteria
- **Conformance Checks**:
  - Ensure the response includes only organizations matching the specified address criteria.
  - Validate that the server returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for successful searches, 400 for malformed queries).
  - Verify that no organizations outside the specified address criteria are returned.

## 3. Pseudocode Implementation

```pseudocode
function testOrganizationAddressSearch():
    # Define test cases with expected outcomes
    testCases = [
        {"address": "123 Main St", "expectedCount": 1},
        {"address-city": "Springfield", "expectedCount": 3},
        {"address-state": "CA", "expectedCount": 5},
        {"address-postalcode": "90210", "expectedCount": 2},
        {"address-country": "USA", "expectedCount": 10},
        {"address": "Nonexistent Address", "expectedCount": 0}
    ]

    for testCase in testCases:
        # Construct the search URL
        searchUrl = constructSearchUrl(testCase)
        
        # Perform the GET request
        response = httpGet(searchUrl)
        
        # Check for successful HTTP response
        assert response.statusCode == 200, "Expected HTTP 200, got " + response.statusCode
        
        # Parse the response
        organizations = parseResponse(response)
        
        # Validate the number of returned organizations
        assert len(organizations) == testCase["expectedCount"], "Mismatch in expected count for " + searchUrl
        
        # Validate that all returned organizations match the search criteria
        for organization in organizations:
            assert matchesCriteria(organization, testCase), "Organization does not match criteria for " + searchUrl

function constructSearchUrl(testCase):
    # Construct the search URL based on the test case parameters
    baseUrl = "[base]/Organization?"
    for key, value in testCase.items():
        if key != "expectedCount":
            baseUrl += key + "=" + encodeURIComponent(value) + "&"
    return baseUrl.strip("&")

function matchesCriteria(organization, testCase):
    # Check if the organization matches the search criteria
    for key, value in testCase.items():
        if key != "expectedCount" and not organizationMatches(organization, key, value):
            return false
    return true

function organizationMatches(organization, key, value):
    # Implement logic to check if the organization matches the key-value criteria
    # This will involve checking the organization's address fields
    return true  # Placeholder for actual implementation
```

## 4. Potential Issues and Edge Cases

### Corner Cases
- **Empty Address Fields**: Ensure that searches with empty address fields return appropriate results.
- **Special Characters**: Test addresses with special characters (e.g., commas, hyphens) to ensure they are handled correctly.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Verify that searches are case-insensitive.

### Performance Considerations
