Definitions for the plannet-Network resource profile.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1. **Organization** | |
| Definition | A formally or informally recognized grouping of people or organizations formed for the purpose of achieving some form of collective action. Includes companies, institutions, corporations, departments, community groups, healthcare practice groups, payer/insurer, etc. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **dom-2**: If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain nested Resources (: contained.contained.empty()) **dom-3**: If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL be referred to from elsewhere in the resource or SHALL refer to the containing resource (: contained.where((('#'+id in (%resource.descendants().reference | %resource.descendants().as(canonical) | %resource.descendants().as(uri) | %resource.descendants().as(url))) or descendants().where(reference = '#').exists() or descendants().where(as(canonical) = '#').exists() or descendants().where(as(canonical) = '#').exists()).not()).trace('unmatched', id).empty()) **dom-4**: If a resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT have a meta.versionId or a meta.lastUpdated (: contained.meta.versionId.empty() and contained.meta.lastUpdated.empty()) **dom-5**: If a resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT have a security label (: contained.meta.security.empty()) **dom-6**: A resource should have narrative for robust management (: text.`div`.exists()) **org-1**: The organization SHALL at least have a name or an identifier, and possibly more than one (: (identifier.count() + name.count()) > 0) |
| 2. **Organization.id** | |
| Definition | The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [string](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#string) |
| Comments | The only time that a resource does not have an id is when it is being submitted to the server using a create operation. |
| 3. **Organization.meta** | |
| Definition | The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [Meta](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Meta) |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 4. **Organization.meta.id** | |
| Definition | Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [string](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#string) |
| 5. **Organization.meta.extension** | |
| Definition | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [Extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html#Extension) |
| Alternate Names | extensions, user content |
| Comments | There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions. The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) **ext-1**: Must have either extensions or value[x], not both (: extension.exists() != value.exists()) |
| [Slicing](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#slicing) | This element introduces a set of slices on Organization.meta.extension. The slices are unordered and Open, and can be differentiated using the following discriminators:  * value @ url |
| 6. **Organization.meta.versionId** | |
| Definition | The version specific identifier, as it appears in the version portion of the URL. This value changes when the resource is created, updated, or deleted. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [id](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#id) |
| Comments | The server assigns this value, and ignores what the client specifies, except in the case that the server is imposing version integrity on updates/deletes. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 7. **Organization.meta.lastUpdated** | |
| Definition | When the resource last changed - e.g. when the version changed. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 1..1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [instant](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#instant) |
| Comments | This value is always populated except when the resource is first being created. The server / resource manager sets this value; what a client provides is irrelevant. This is equivalent to the HTTP Last-Modified and SHOULD have the same value on a [read](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#read) interaction. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 8. **Organization.meta.source** | |
| Definition | A uri that identifies the source system of the resource. This provides a minimal amount of [Provenance](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/provenance.html#) information that can be used to track or differentiate the source of information in the resource. The source may identify another FHIR server, document, message, database, etc. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [uri](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#uri) |
| Comments | In the provenance resource, this corresponds to Provenance.entity.what[x]. The exact use of the source (and the implied Provenance.entity.role) is left to implementer discretion. Only one nominated source is allowed; for additional provenance details, a full Provenance resource should be used.  This element can be used to indicate where the current master source of a resource that has a canonical URL if the resource is no longer hosted at the canonical URL. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 9. **Organization.meta.profile** | |
| Definition | A list of profiles (references to [StructureDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition.html#) resources) that this resource claims to conform to. The URL is a reference to [StructureDefinition.url](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.url). |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [canonical](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#canonical)([StructureDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition.html "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/StructureDefinition")) |
| Comments | It is up to the server and/or other infrastructure of policy to determine whether/how these claims are verified and/or updated over time. The list of profile URLs is a set. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 10. **Organization.meta.security** | |
| Definition | Security labels applied to this resource. These tags connect specific resources to the overall security policy and infrastructure. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* |
| [Binding](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologies.html) | The codes SHALL be taken from [All Security Labels](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-security-labels.html); other codes may be used where these codes are not suitable Security Labels from the Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification System. |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [Coding](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Coding) |
| Comments | The security labels can be updated without changing the stated version of the resource. The list of security labels is a set. Uniqueness is based the system/code, and version and display are ignored. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 11. **Organization.meta.tag** | |
| Definition | Tags applied to this resource. Tags are intended to be used to identify and relate resources to process and workflow, and applications are not required to consider the tags when interpreting the meaning of a resource. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* |
| [Binding](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologies.html) | For example codes, see [CommonTags](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-common-tags.html) Codes that represent various types of tags, commonly workflow-related; e.g. "Needs review by Dr. Jones". |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [Coding](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Coding) |
| Comments | The tags can be updated without changing the stated version of the resource. The list of tags is a set. Uniqueness is based the system/code, and version and display are ignored. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 12. **Organization.implicitRules** | |
| Definition | A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [uri](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#uri) |
| [Is Modifier](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#ismodifier) | true |
| Comments | Asserting this rule set restricts the content to be only understood by a limited set of trading partners. This inherently limits the usefulness of the data in the long term. However, the existing health eco-system is highly fractured, and not yet ready to define, collect, and exchange data in a generally computable sense. Wherever possible, implementers and/or specification writers should avoid using this element. Often, when used, the URL is a reference to an implementation guide that defines these special rules as part of it's narrative along with other profiles, value sets, etc. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 13. **Organization.language** | |
| Definition | The base language in which the resource is written. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |
| [Binding](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologies.html) | The codes SHOULD be taken from [CommonLanguages](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-languages.html) [Max Binding](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-elementdefinition-maxvalueset.html "Max Value Set Extension"): [AllLanguages](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-all-languages.html) A human language. |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [code](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#code) |
| Comments | Language is provided to support indexing and accessibility (typically, services such as text to speech use the language tag). The html language tag in the narrative applies to the narrative. The language tag on the resource may be used to specify the language of other presentations generated from the data in the resource. Not all the content has to be in the base language. The Resource.language should not be assumed to apply to the narrative automatically. If a language is specified, it should it also be specified on the div element in the html (see rules in HTML5 for information about the relationship between xml:lang and the html lang attribute). |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 14. **Organization.text** | |
| Definition | A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [Narrative](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Narrative) |
| Alternate Names | narrative, html, xhtml, display |
| Comments | Contained resources do not have narrative. Resources that are not contained SHOULD have a narrative. In some cases, a resource may only have text with little or no additional discrete data (as long as all minOccurs=1 elements are satisfied). This may be necessary for data from legacy systems where information is captured as a "text blob" or where text is additionally entered raw or narrated and encoded information is added later. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 15. **Organization.contained** | |
| Definition | These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resource.html) |
| Alternate Names | inline resources, anonymous resources, contained resources |
| Comments | This should never be done when the content can be identified properly, as once identification is lost, it is extremely difficult (and context dependent) to restore it again. Contained resources may have profiles and tags In their meta elements, but SHALL NOT have security labels. |
| 16. **Organization.extension** | |
| Definition | An Extension |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [Extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html#Extension) |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) **ext-1**: Must have either extensions or value[x], not both (: extension.exists() != value.exists()) |
| [Slicing](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#slicing) | This element introduces a set of slices on Organization.extension. The slices are unordered and Open, and can be differentiated using the following discriminators:  * value @ url |
| 17. **Organization.extension:location-reference** | |
| [SliceName](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#slicing) | location-reference |
| Definition | A reference to a Location resource (plannet-Location) defining the coverage area of a health insurance provider network |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* This element is affected by the following invariants: ele-1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [Extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html#Extension)([LocationReference](StructureDefinition-location-reference.html "[CanonicalType[http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex-plan-net/StructureDefinition/location-reference]]")) (Extension Type: [Reference](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/references.html#Reference)([PlannetLocation](StructureDefinition-plannet-Location.html "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex-plan-net/StructureDefinition/plannet-Location"))) |
| [Must Support](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#mustSupport) | true |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) **ext-1**: Must have either extensions or value[x], not both (: extension.exists() != value.exists()) |
| 18. **Organization.modifierExtension** | |
| Definition | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [Extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html#Extension) |
| [Is Modifier](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#ismodifier) | true |
| Requirements | Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be safely ignored. This promotes interoperability by eliminating the need for implementers to prohibit the presence of extensions. For further information, see the [definition of modifier extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html#modifierExtension). |
| Alternate Names | extensions, user content |
| Comments | There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions. The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) **ext-1**: Must have either extensions or value[x], not both (: extension.exists() != value.exists()) |
| 19. **Organization.identifier** | |
| Definition | Identifier for the organization that is used to identify the organization across multiple disparate systems. |
| Note | This is a business identifier, not a resource identifier (see [discussion](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resource.html#identifiers)) |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..\* This element is affected by the following invariants: org-1 |

| [Must Support](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#mustSupport) | true |
| Requirements | Organizations are known by a variety of ids. Some institutions maintain several, and most collect identifiers for exchange with other organizations concerning the organization. |
| Comments | NPI preferred. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| [Slicing](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#slicing) | This element introduces a set of slices on Organization.identifier. The slices are unordered and Open, and can be differentiated using the following discriminators:  * pattern @ $this |
| 20. **Organization.identifier.id** | |
| Definition | Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |

| Definition | May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. |

| Requirements | Allows the appropriate identifier for a particular context of use to be selected from among a set of identifiers. |
| Comments | Applications can assume that an identifier is permanent unless it explicitly says that it is temporary. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 23. **Organization.identifier.type** | |
| Definition | A coded type for the identifier that can be used to determine which identifier to use for a specific purpose. |

| [Must Support](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#mustSupport) | true |
| Requirements | Allows users to make use of identifiers when the identifier system is not known. |
| Comments | This element deals only with general categories of identifiers. It SHOULD not be used for codes that correspond 1..1 with the Identifier.system. Some identifiers may fall into multiple categories due to common usage. Where the system is known, a type is unnecessary because the type is always part of the system definition. However systems often need to handle identifiers where the system is not known. There is not a 1:1 relationship between type and system, since many different systems have the same type. |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 24. **Organization.identifier.system** | |
| Definition | Establishes the namespace for the value - that is, a URL that describes a set values that are unique. |
| [Control](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#conformance) | 0..1 |
| [Type](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html) | [uri](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#uri) |
| [Must Support](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#mustSupport) | true |
| Requirements | There are many sets of identifiers. To perform matching of two identifiers, we need to know what set we're dealing with. The system identifies a particular set of unique identifiers. |
| Comments | Identifier.system is always case sensitive. |
| Example | **General**:http://www.acme.com/identifiers/patient |
| Invariants | **Defined on this element**  **ele-1**: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) |
| 25. **Organization.identifier.value** | |

| [Must Support](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conformance-rules.html#mustSupport) | true |
| Comments | If the value is a full URI, then the system SHALL be urn:ietf:rfc:3986. The value's primary purpose is computational mapping. As a result, it may be normalized for comparison purposes (e.g. removing non-significant whitespace, dashes, etc.) A value formatted for human display can be conveyed using the [Rendered Value extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-rendered-value.html).

| Requirements | Need to be able to track the kind of organization that this is - different organization types have different uses. |
| Comments | Organizations can be corporations, wards, sections, clinical teams, government departments, etc. Note that code is generally a classifier of the type of organization; in many applications, codes are used to identity a particular organization (say, ward) as opposed to another of the same type - these are identifiers, not codes  When considering if multiple types are appropriate, you should evaluate if child organizations would be a more appropriate use of the concept, as different types likely are in different sub-areas of the organization. This is most likely to be used where type values have orthogonal values, such as a religious, academic and medical center.  We expect that some jurisdictions will profile this optionality to be a single cardinality. |

| Comments | The definition of Address states that "address is intended to describe postal addresses, not physical locations". However, many applications track whether an address has a dual purpose of being a location that can be visited as well as being a valid delivery destination, and Postal addresses are often used as proxies for physical locations (also see the [Location](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/location.html#) resource). |
