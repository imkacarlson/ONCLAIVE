Practitioner is a person who is directly or indirectly involved in the provisioning of healthcare.

### Implementation Guidance

Practitioner language skills can be encoded through the communication field and the communication-proficiency extension. Qualifications that may be of interest to the consumer can be communicate through the qualification field and its associated extension. For languages not enumerated in the [CommonLanguages Value Set](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-languages.html) the [BCP47 Language Subtag lookup tool](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/)  may be useful to identify an appropriate language code.

When the value set for the coded concept in qualification is insufficient, the qualification can be provided in the text field of the codeableConcept.

**Usage:**

* Refer to this Resource Profile:
* Examples for this Resource Profile: [Practitioner/Counselor](Practitioner-Counselor.html), [Practitioner/HansSolo](Practitioner-HansSolo.html), [Practitioner/JoeSmith](Practitioner-JoeSmith.html)
