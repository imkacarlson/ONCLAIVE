The HealthCareService resource typically describes services offered by an organization/practitioner at a location. The resource may be used to encompass a variety of services covering the entire healthcare spectrum, including promotion, prevention, diagnostics, pharmacy, hospital and ambulatory care, home care, long-term care, and other health-related and community services.

### Implementation Guidance

<* To use the coverageArea the preferred form of reference is to create a Location instance with the State or region specified, and possibly provide a GeoJSON.

**Usage:**
