An InsurancePlan is a discrete package of health insurance coverage benefits that are offered under a particular network type. A given payer’s products typically differ by network type and/or covered benefits. A plan pairs a product’s covered benefits with the particular cost sharing structure offered to a consumer. A given product may comprise multiple plans (i.e. each plan offers different cost sharing requirements for the same set of covered benefits).

InsurancePlan describes a health insurance offering comprised of a list of covered benefits (i.e. the product), costs associated with those benefits (i.e. the plan), and additional information about the offering, such as who it is owned and administered by, a coverage area, contact information, etc.

### Implementation Guidance

* Note that the relationship between InsurancePlans and Networks is many-to-many. A plan may be associated with multiple networks, and a network may be associated with many plans.
  In this IG, this is modeled by having InsurancePlans reference networks (directionality of relationship supports this).
* Networks referenced with InsurancePlan.network apply to all InsurancePlan.plan cost sharing plans. If InsurancePlan.network is not provided, each cost sharing plan must provide at least one network in InsurancePlan.plan.network.
* To use the coverageArea the preferred form of reference is to create a Location instance with the State or region specified, and possibly provide a GeoJSON.
