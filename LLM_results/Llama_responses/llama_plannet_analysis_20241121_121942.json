Here's a breakdown of how data is represented:\n\n1. **Profiles**: The guide defines several profiles that extend the base FHIR resources to meet the specific requirements of PDex Plan Net. Profiles provide additional constraints and mappings to facilitate interoperability. The profiles define specific elements, extensions, and value sets that are used to represent data.\n2. **Resources**: The guide defines several resources that are used to represent data, including:\n\t* **PlanDefinition** ( profiled as `PDEXPlan-PlanDefinition`): represents a detailed plan related to a patient's care, including goals, problems, medications, and activities.\n\t* **CarePlan** (profiled as `PDEXCarePlan-Partners\"): represents a specific care plan for a patient, including the healthcare providers and organizations responsible for the patient's care.\n\t* **Organization** (profiled as `PDEXOrganization-Partner`): represents a healthcare organization involved in the patient's care, including the relevant contact information and other details.\n\t* **Practitioner**: represents a healthcare professional involved in the patient's care, including their name, contact information, and qualifications.\n\t* **Location** (profiled as `PDEXLocation-Location`): represents a geographic location relevant to the patient's care, such as a hospital or physician's office.\n3. **Extensions**: The guide uses extensions to represent additional data elements that are not part of the standard FHIR resources. These extensions are defined using the FHIR ExtensionDefinition resource and provide a way to include additional data without modifying the base FHIR resources.\n4. **Value Sets**: The guide defines value sets that constrain the allowed values for specific elements within the profiles. Value sets provide a way to ensure that the data being shared is consistent and follows specific rules.\n5. **Relationships**: The resources defined in the guide have relationships with each other, such as a CarePlan being associated with a patient or a practitioner being part of an organization. These relationships are represented using FHIR's built-in mechanisms, such as the `contact` element for specifying the practitioners involved in a patient's care.\n\nBy defining a set of profiles, resources, extensions, and value sets, the FHIR DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide provides a standardized way for healthcare organizations to share data about patients' care, facilitating coordination and communication across different healthcare settings.",
