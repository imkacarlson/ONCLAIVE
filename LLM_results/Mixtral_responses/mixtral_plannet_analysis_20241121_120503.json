It includes RESTful API operations that support the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) paradigm. Here are some examples of actions or operations that can be used:\n\n1. Create: A client, such as an EHR or pharmacy system, can submit a new prescription to the Payer's system using a POST request. This action might involve creating a new `MedicationRequest` resource.\n\n2. Read: After a prescription has been submitted, a client can retrieve the status of that prescription using a GET request. This operation might involve reading the `MedicationRequest` or `Task` resource to check its status.\n\n3. Update: If the prescription's details need to be modified (e.g., the dosage changed), the client can send an updated prescription using a PUT or PATCH request. This operation might involve updating the `MedicationRequest` or `Task` resource.\n\n4. Delete: If a prescription is canceled or discontinued, a client can send a DELETE request to remove the prescription from the Payer's system. Note that this operation might not be fully supported in all implementations due to regulatory or auditing requirements.\n\nOther operations based on FHIR's CRUD paradigm can include:\n\n1. Search: Clients can search or filter prescriptions based on various criteria, such as patient name, medication name, or date. This operation might involve performing a GET request and using search parameters with the `MedicationRequest` or related resources.\n\n2. History: Clients can retrieve the history of a prescription or a patient's medication history by accessing Payer's system. This operation might involve reading the `MedicationRequest`, `Task`, and related resources while looking at their versions or history.",

Encounter Alert Notifications: While required to support the reception of alerts, actors are not strictly required to issue them. It is optional for implementations to choose to send these notifications.\n\n2. Configuration Options: The guide specifies several optional configuration options for compliant implementations, including adjustments to the order and limits of results returned, authentication option support, and others.\n\n3. Supplementary Transaction Types: There are several supplementary transaction types that are optional for implementations. These include Query for Existing Data, Retrieve Document, Find Document References, and others.\n\n4. Vocabulary Bindings: While the guide does require specific bindings for particular vocabularies, additional bindings for other supported vocabularies are optional.\n\n5. Capability Statements: Implementations may optionally add additional, implementation-specific capabilities to their HL7 Capability Statements.\n\n6. Endpoint Configuration: Although certain endpoints are required, implementations may optionally register and support additional, non-required endpoints.\n\n7. Security: Implementations are expected to comply with various baseline security standards, but may optionally employ additional security measures as deemed appropriate.\n\n8. Document Templates: While the guide specifies a basic set of document templates, additional document templates are optional and left to the discretion of the implementation.\n\n9. Conformance: Although not an explicit requirement, the guide encourages implementations to validate conformance to the PDEX implementation by providing tools and documentation.\n\nIt is highly recommended to consult the most recent version of the DaVinci PDex Plan Net Implementation Guide for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding optional requirements and rules.",
